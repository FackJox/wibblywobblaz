## Overview
Implement comprehensive visual feedback systems for the Decks application, including canvas-based waveform visualization, BPM detection and display, track progress indicators, and cue point markers to provide DJs with essential visual cues for mixing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Canvas-based waveform visualization renders for loaded tracks
- [ ] Waveforms display amplitude variations clearly and accurately
- [ ] BPM detection algorithm analyzes tracks and displays tempo
- [ ] Real-time BPM display updates during playback
- [ ] Track progress indicators show current playback position
- [ ] Progress indicators are synchronized with audio playback
- [ ] Cue point markers can be placed and visualized on waveforms
- [ ] Cue points persist and can be jumped to during playback
- [ ] Visual feedback is responsive and performs well on mobile devices
- [ ] Color coding differentiates between different visual elements
- [ ] Waveform zoom functionality allows detailed view of audio sections
- [ ] Visual elements update smoothly without causing performance issues

## Technical Requirements
- Canvas API for high-performance waveform rendering
- Web Audio API integration for real-time analysis
- BPM detection using audio analysis techniques
- Efficient rendering pipeline for smooth animations
- Touch-friendly cue point placement on mobile
- Optimized drawing routines for 60fps performance

## Implementation Notes
- Use Canvas API instead of SVG for better performance with large waveforms
- Implement BPM detection using beat detection algorithms (peaks, onset detection)
- Cache waveform data to avoid re-computation on re-render
- Use RequestAnimationFrame for smooth progress indicator updates
- Consider Web Workers for heavy audio analysis to avoid blocking UI
- Implement virtual scrolling for very long tracks

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 24-32 hours
- **Complexity**: High - requires audio analysis, canvas optimization, and real-time performance

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Task 002 (Enhanced Audio Controls) for audio playback foundation
- Audio context and file loading infrastructure must be established
- Playback controls need to be functional for testing visual feedback

## Testing Strategy
- Visual regression testing for waveform rendering accuracy
- Performance testing with various track lengths and formats
- BPM detection accuracy testing against known reference tracks
- Mobile responsiveness testing across different screen sizes
- Memory usage testing for long mixing sessions
