# Task 003: Audio Routing - Parallel Work Analysis

## Overview
Task 003 implements professional audio routing system with crossfader, 3-band EQ per channel, channel mixing logic, and proper gain staging. The system processes audio in real-time with low latency (<20ms) and provides seamless DJ mixing capabilities. This is a complex audio processing task that can be decomposed into 5 independent work streams.

- Add kill switch functionality for each band
- Match professional DJ mixer frequency response curves

### Stream 4: Crossfader Implementation
**Scope**: Build `Crossfader` class with multiple curve types and smooth blending
**Files to create/modify**:
- `lib/audio/Crossfader.ts` (create)
- `lib/audio/curves/crossfaderCurves.ts` (create)
- `lib/audio/utils/audioBlending.ts` (create)

**Agent type**: backend-architect
**Start condition**: Requires Stream 1 (AudioRouter) foundation
**Estimated hours**: 6-8 hours
**Details**:
- Implement crossfader with linear and constant power curves
- Create smooth audio blending between decks

### Stream 5: UI Integration & Controls
**Scope**: Integrate audio routing with existing UI components and add visual feedback
**Files to create/modify**:
- `components/decks/CrossfaderControl.tsx` (create)
- `components/decks/EQControls.tsx` (create)
- `components/decks/ChannelControls.tsx` (create)
- `components/decks/MasterSection.tsx` (create)
- `hooks/useAudioRouting.ts` (create)

**Agent type**: frontend-developer
**Start condition**: Can start immediately (UI components independent of audio logic)
**Estimated hours**: 8-10 hours
**Details**:
- Create crossfader UI using existing Slider component
- Build EQ knob controls with center detent functionality
- Implement gain controls with visual feedback
- Add PFL buttons with active states
- Create master level meter using Progress component

## Coordination Points

### Sync Point 1: Audio Interface Definition (After 2 days)
- **Participants**: Streams 1, 2, 3, 4
- **Purpose**: Align on audio processing interfaces and data flow
- **Deliverable**: Shared TypeScript interfaces and audio graph structure

### Sync Point 2: Integration Testing (After 1 week)
- **Participants**: All streams
- **Purpose**: Integrate all audio components and resolve interface conflicts
- **Deliverable**: Working audio routing system with basic UI

### Sync Point 3: Performance Optimization (After 1.5 weeks)
- **Participants**: Streams 1, 2, 3, 4 (audio processing)
- **Purpose**: Optimize audio performance and eliminate latency issues
- **Deliverable**: Performance-tuned audio system meeting <20ms latency requirement

## Conflict Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Conflicts:
- **Stream 5 (UI)** vs others: Independent development, interfaces defined upfront
- **Stream 2 (ChannelStrip)** vs **Stream 3 (EQ)**: Separate audio processors, clear boundaries

### Medium Risk Conflicts:
- **Stream 1 (AudioRouter)** vs **Stream 4 (Crossfader)**: Both manage audio graph connections
  - *Mitigation*: Define clear API boundaries at Sync Point 1
- **Stream 2 (ChannelStrip)** vs **Stream 4 (Crossfader)**: Audio flow integration points
  - *Mitigation*: Establish signal flow protocol early

### High Risk Conflicts:
- **Performance optimization conflicts**: All audio streams affect overall system performance
  - *Mitigation*: Dedicated performance testing phase with all audio streams

## Parallelization Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
- **Parallel**: Streams 1, 2, 3, 5 start simultaneously
- **Sequential**: Stream 4 waits for Stream 1 basic structure
- **Focus**: Core infrastructure and independent components

### Phase 2: Integration (Days 4-7)
- **Parallel**: All streams continue development
- **Coordination**: Daily standup for interface alignment
- **Milestone**: Sync Point 1 - Interface definitions locked

### Phase 3: System Integration (Days 8-10)
- **Parallel**: Final implementation and integration testing
- **Coordination**: Sync Point 2 - Full system integration
- **Focus**: End-to-end audio routing functionality

### Phase 4: Optimization (Days 11-12)
- **Sequential**: Performance optimization and fine-tuning
- **Coordination**: Sync Point 3 - Performance requirements met
- **Focus**: Latency optimization and mobile device testing

## Expected Timeline

### Without Parallelization (Sequential):
- **Total Duration**: 32-42 hours (4-5.5 weeks for single developer)
- **Critical Path**: AudioRouter → ChannelStrip → EQProcessor → Crossfader → UI Integration
- **Risk**: Long feedback cycles, late discovery of integration issues

### With Parallelization (5 agents):
- **Total Duration**: 12-14 days (2-2.5 weeks with coordination overhead)
- **Critical Path**: Stream 1 (AudioRouter) foundation, then parallel development
- **Benefits**: 
  - Faster delivery (60% time reduction)
  - Early problem discovery through parallel integration
  - Specialized expertise per stream
  - Reduced single-point-of-failure risk

### Recommended Execution:
- **Day 1**: Start Streams 1, 2, 3, 5 in parallel
- **Day 2**: Start Stream 4 once Stream 1 provides basic AudioRouter interface
- **Day 3**: Sync Point 1 - Interface alignment
- **Day 7**: Sync Point 2 - Integration testing
- **Day 10**: Sync Point 3 - Performance optimization
- **Day 12**: Final testing and delivery

This parallelization strategy reduces delivery time from 4-5.5 weeks to 2-2.5 weeks while maintaining code quality and system performance requirements.
