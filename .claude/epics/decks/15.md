## Overview
Implement collaborative queue functionality for the Decks application, enabling real-time music requests and queue management through WebSocket connections, QR code sharing for easy mobile access, and a streamlined mobile submission interface that allows audience participation in DJ sets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket/Socket.io server setup for real-time communication
- [ ] Real-time queue synchronization across all connected clients
- [ ] QR code generation for easy session sharing
- [ ] Mobile-optimized submission interface for track requests
- [ ] Queue management controls for DJ (accept, reject, reorder)
- [ ] Real-time notifications for new requests and queue updates
- [ ] Session management with unique room codes/URLs
- [ ] Audience voting system for track popularity
- [ ] Request moderation and spam protection
- [ ] Queue persistence across disconnections
- [ ] Mobile UI optimized for quick track selection and submission
- [ ] Integration with track library for request fulfillment

## Technical Requirements
- WebSocket server implementation (Socket.io recommended)
- QR code generation library integration
- Mobile-responsive UI for submission interface
- Real-time state synchronization architecture
- Session management and room-based connections
- Rate limiting and spam protection mechanisms
- Persistent queue storage (Redis or database)

## Implementation Notes
- Use Socket.io for robust WebSocket connections with fallbacks
- Implement room-based architecture for isolated DJ sessions
- Generate QR codes linking to mobile submission interface
- Design mobile-first UI for track requests with minimal friction
- Implement proper authentication/authorization for DJ vs audience roles
- Use optimistic updates with rollback for better UX
- Consider implementing request approval workflow
- Store queue state in Redis for scalability and persistence
- Implement reconnection handling for network interruptions

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 28-36 hours
- **Complexity**: High - real-time systems, mobile optimization, and state synchronization

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Task 002 (Enhanced Audio Controls) for queue integration with playback
- Audio playback system must be functional for queue execution
- Track library system helpful but not strictly required for basic functionality

## Testing Strategy
- Real-time synchronization testing across multiple clients
- Mobile device testing for QR code scanning and submission
- Network interruption and reconnection testing
- Load testing with multiple concurrent requests
- Queue persistence testing across server restarts
- Cross-browser WebSocket compatibility testing
- Rate limiting and spam protection validation
