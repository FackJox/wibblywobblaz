# Issue #18 Stream B Progress - UI Controls & Visualization

## Completed Work

### Recording Control Panel (✅ Complete)
- **File**: `components/decks/recording-controls.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Start/stop/pause recording controls with proper state management
  - Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+R (start/resume), Ctrl+Space (pause), Ctrl+Shift+S (stop)
  - Compact and full layout modes
  - Real-time status indicators with recording duration and file size
  - Error handling and accessibility support
  - Integration with RecordingStore for state management

### Real-time Level Meters (✅ Complete)
- **File**: `components/decks/recording-meter.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Horizontal and vertical meter orientations
  - Peak hold indicators with auto-decay
  - Color-coded level indicators (blue/green/yellow/red)
  - Support for stereo left/right channel display
  - Configurable dimensions and styling
  - Real-time updates during recording

### Waveform Visualization (✅ Complete)
- **File**: `components/decks/waveform-recorder.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time waveform drawing on HTML5 canvas
  - Scrolling waveform with configurable sample buffer
  - Recording state indicators with visual feedback
  - Peak level overlay display
  - Throttled updates for performance optimization
  - Responsive canvas sizing

### Recording Status Display (✅ Complete)
- **File**: `components/decks/recording-status.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive status information (recording state, duration, file size)
  - Storage usage monitoring with visual progress bars
  - Audio level summaries with color-coded indicators
  - Quality settings display and recording statistics
  - System capability indicators
  - Compact and full layout modes

## Technical Implementation

### State Management Integration
All components properly integrate with the existing `RecordingStore` from Stream A:
- Real-time updates from store subscriptions
- Proper error handling and state synchronization
- Keyboard shortcut handling with conflict prevention

### UI/UX Design
- Consistent with existing component patterns in `/components/decks/`
- Uses shadcn/ui components and design system
- Responsive design with mobile-friendly layouts
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Visual feedback for all user interactions

### Performance Optimizations
- Throttled animation frame updates for smooth performance
- Canvas-based waveform rendering for efficiency
- Proper cleanup of timers and animation frames
- Memory management for waveform sample buffers

## File Structure
```
components/decks/
├── recording-controls.tsx    # Main control panel
├── recording-meter.tsx       # Audio level meters
├── waveform-recorder.tsx     # Real-time waveform
└── recording-status.tsx      # Status indicators
```

## Next Steps for Integration
The UI components are complete and ready for integration. To use them:

1. Import components in parent layouts
2. Components automatically connect to RecordingStore
3. No additional setup required - they handle their own state
4. Keyboard shortcuts work globally when components are mounted

## Keyboard Shortcuts Implemented
- **Ctrl+R**: Start recording / Resume from pause
- **Ctrl+Space**: Pause/resume recording
- **Ctrl+Shift+S**: Stop recording
- Shortcuts respect input field focus to prevent conflicts

## Dependencies Met
- ✅ Uses existing RecordingStore from Stream A
- ✅ Integrates with audio level data from recorder
- ✅ Follows existing component patterns
- ✅ Uses established UI component library
- ✅ Implements responsive design principles

All work for Stream B (UI Controls & Visualization) has been completed successfully.
