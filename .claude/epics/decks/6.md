## Overview
Establish the foundational audio infrastructure for the Decks application, including Web Audio API context management, basic playback controls, and file upload functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Web Audio API context is properly initialized and managed
- [ ] Audio files can be loaded and decoded successfully
- [ ] Basic transport controls (play/pause/stop) work reliably
- [ ] Volume control is implemented with proper gain staging
- [ ] File upload accepts common audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A)
- [ ] Audio waveform data can be extracted for visualization
- [ ] Proper error handling for unsupported files or audio context failures
- [ ] Audio playback works across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Technical Requirements
- Use native Web Audio API (no external audio libraries initially)
- Implement audio context with proper user gesture activation
- Support for multiple audio formats via HTML5 Audio API
- Extract audio buffer data for waveform generation
- Implement proper cleanup for audio resources

## Implementation Details
- Create `AudioManager` class to handle Web Audio API context
- Implement `AudioTrack` class for individual track management
- Use existing Button components for transport controls
- Use existing Slider components for volume control
- File upload using HTML5 File API with drag-and-drop support
- Audio decoding with progress feedback for large files

## UI Components to Use
- Button (existing) - for play/pause/stop controls
- Slider (existing) - for volume control
- Card (existing) - for track information display
- Progress (existing) - for loading indicators

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M (Medium)
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Complexity: Medium-High (Web Audio API learning curve)

## Dependencies
None - this is the foundation task

## Notes
- Focus on clean API design for future deck integration
- Consider mobile browser limitations with Web Audio API
- Implement proper audio context resume for user interaction requirements
- Plan for future features like tempo detection and audio analysis
