## Overview
Create the visual interface for dual deck DJ layout with professional-grade transport controls, track information display, and responsive design for both mobile and desktop experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Two-deck layout with symmetrical design
- [ ] Each deck has dedicated transport controls (play, pause, cue, loop)
- [ ] Volume faders and pitch sliders per deck
- [ ] Track information display (title, artist, duration, BPM)
- [ ] Waveform visualization placeholder areas
- [ ] Responsive layout that works on mobile (stacked) and desktop (side-by-side)
- [ ] Visual feedback for active states (playing, cueing, etc.)
- [ ] Drag and drop zones for audio file loading
- [ ] Progress indicators for track position

## Technical Requirements
- Build using existing shadcn/ui components
- Responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS
- Component composition pattern for deck controls
- State management for deck status and track information
- Touch-friendly controls for mobile devices
- Keyboard shortcuts for desktop DJ workflow

## Implementation Details
- Create `DeckController` component for individual deck UI
- Use Card components for deck containers and track info
- Implement transport controls with Button components
- Volume/pitch controls using Slider components
- Track progress using Progress component
- Drag-and-drop integration with file upload from Task 001
- Visual states using Tailwind classes and CSS variables

## UI Components to Use
- Card (existing) - deck containers and track info panels
- Button (existing) - transport controls (play, pause, cue)
- Slider (existing) - volume, pitch, and position controls
- Progress (existing) - track position and loading states
- Badge (existing) - BPM and key information
- Separator (existing) - visual separation between decks

## Responsive Design
- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Stacked deck layout, larger touch targets
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: Compact side-by-side layout
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: Full professional layout with all controls visible

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L (Large)
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Complexity: Medium (UI composition and responsive design)

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (Audio Foundation) - requires audio loading and basic controls

## Notes
- Design should feel familiar to users of Serato, Traktor, or Virtual DJ
- Consider accessibility for keyboard navigation
- Plan component architecture for easy addition of future features (EQ, effects)
- Use consistent spacing and visual hierarchy throughout
