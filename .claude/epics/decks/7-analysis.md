# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #7

## Overview
Create the visual interface for dual deck DJ layout with professional-grade transport controls, track information display, and responsive design. This builds directly on the audio foundation from Issue #6.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core Deck Structure & Layout
**Scope**: Main deck components, responsive grid layout, deck containers
**Files**:
- `components/decks/DeckController.tsx` - Main deck component
- `components/decks/DeckLayout.tsx` - Dual deck layout manager
- `app/decks/dual/page.tsx` - Dual deck page setup
**Agent Type**: frontend-developer
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 6
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Transport Controls & Integration
**Scope**: Play/pause/cue/loop controls, integration with AudioManager
**Files**:
- `components/decks/TransportBar.tsx` - Full transport control bar
- `components/decks/CueControl.tsx` - Cue point management
- `components/decks/LoopControl.tsx` - Loop controls
**Agent Type**: frontend-developer
**Can Start**: immediately (uses existing TransportControls from #6)
**Estimated Hours**: 5
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Sliders & Visual Controls
**Scope**: Volume faders, pitch sliders, crossfader, EQ knobs
**Files**:
- `components/decks/PitchControl.tsx` - Pitch slider with reset
- `components/decks/Crossfader.tsx` - Crossfader component
- `components/decks/EQControls.tsx` - 3-band EQ interface
**Agent Type**: frontend-developer  
**Can Start**: immediately (uses existing Slider components)
**Estimated Hours**: 6
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream D: Track Display & Information
**Scope**: Track info panels, waveform areas, progress indicators
**Files**:
- `components/decks/TrackDisplay.tsx` - Track information display
- `components/decks/WaveformDisplay.tsx` - Waveform visualization area
- `components/decks/TrackProgress.tsx` - Progress and position display
**Agent Type**: frontend-developer
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 5
**Dependencies**: none

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- `lib/decks/types.ts` - Shared types for deck state (all streams)
- `lib/decks/deckStore.ts` - Zustand store for deck state (Streams A & B)

### Sequential Requirements
1. Core deck structure provides mounting points for controls
2. All streams integrate into DeckController component
3. State management needs to coordinate between decks

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Components work in separate files
- **Medium Risk**: Integration points in DeckController
- **Mitigation**: Clear component boundaries and props interfaces

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Full Parallel

All four streams can start immediately and work independently:
- Stream A creates the container structure
- Stream B implements transport controls  
- Stream C builds slider controls
- Stream D creates information displays

Timeline:
- Hour 0-6: All streams run in parallel
- Hour 6-7: Integration and testing

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 7 hours
- Total work: 22 hours
- Efficiency gain: 68%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 22 hours

## Notes

### Critical Considerations
- Mobile responsiveness is crucial - test on real devices
- Touch targets need to be large enough for mobile DJ use
- Keyboard shortcuts should work for desktop power users
- Visual feedback for all interactive elements
- Performance optimization for smooth 60fps interactions

### Recommended Agent Assignments
1. **Frontend Developer 1**: Stream A (deck structure and layout)
2. **Frontend Developer 2**: Stream B (transport controls)
3. **Frontend Developer 3**: Stream C (sliders and faders)
4. **Frontend Developer 4**: Stream D (track display)

### Success Metrics
- Dual deck layout works on mobile (stacked) and desktop (side-by-side)
- All controls provide immediate visual feedback
- State synchronizes correctly between decks
- Touch and keyboard controls both work smoothly
- No layout shift or jank during interactions
