# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #13

## Overview
Implement comprehensive file management with IndexedDB persistence, track library UI, metadata extraction, and storage management. This task is marked as parallel:true and can run concurrently with other epic tasks.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: IndexedDB Infrastructure
**Scope**: Database schema, migrations, CRUD operations, error handling
**Files**:
- `lib/storage/database.ts` - IndexedDB setup with Dexie
- `lib/storage/trackStore.ts` - Track CRUD operations
- `lib/storage/migrations.ts` - Database migrations
**Agent Type**: backend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 5
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Track Library UI
**Scope**: Library display, search/filter, playlist management UI
**Files**:
- `components/library/TrackLibrary.tsx` - Main library component
- `components/library/TrackList.tsx` - Track list with virtualization
- `components/library/SearchFilter.tsx` - Search and filter controls
- `components/library/PlaylistManager.tsx` - Playlist organization
**Agent Type**: frontend-developer
**Can Start**: immediately (can mock data initially)
**Estimated Hours**: 5
**Dependencies**: none (uses mock data until Stream A ready)

### Stream C: File Processing & Metadata
**Scope**: Metadata extraction, waveform generation, batch processing
**Files**:
- `lib/audio/MetadataExtractor.ts` - Extract ID3 tags and metadata
- `lib/audio/WaveformGenerator.ts` - Generate waveform previews
- `lib/audio/BatchProcessor.ts` - Handle bulk file uploads
**Agent Type**: backend-architect
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream D: Storage Management & Utilities
**Scope**: Quota monitoring, export/import, cleanup utilities
**Files**:
- `lib/storage/StorageManager.ts` - Quota and cleanup management
- `lib/storage/ExportImport.ts` - Library backup/restore
- `components/library/StorageIndicator.tsx` - Storage usage UI
**Agent Type**: fullstack-developer
**Can Start**: after Stream A (needs database)
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: Stream A

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- `lib/storage/types.ts` - Shared types for tracks and playlists
- `lib/audio/types.ts` - Audio-related types (already exists from #6)

### Sequential Requirements
1. Database schema must be defined before storage utilities
2. Track store API needed before UI can persist data
3. Metadata extraction feeds into database storage

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Clean separation between storage, UI, and processing
- **Medium Risk**: Type definitions need coordination
- **Mitigation**: Define interfaces early, use dependency injection

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Staggered Parallel

Start Streams A, B, C immediately. Stream D starts once A completes:
- Streams A, B, C work independently with mocked interfaces
- Stream D builds on database infrastructure from A
- Final integration once all streams complete

Timeline:
- Hour 0-5: Streams A, B, C run in parallel
- Hour 5-9: Stream D runs, integration work begins
- Hour 9-10: Final testing and polish

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 10 hours
- Total work: 18 hours
- Efficiency gain: 44%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 18 hours

## Notes

### Critical Considerations
- IndexedDB has browser storage limits - implement quota checking
- Web Workers for heavy processing to avoid UI blocking
- Metadata extraction must handle various tag formats (ID3v1, ID3v2, etc.)
- Waveform data should be compressed for storage efficiency
- Search needs to be fast even with hundreds of tracks

### Recommended Agent Assignments
1. **Backend Architect 1**: Stream A (database infrastructure)
2. **Frontend Developer**: Stream B (library UI)
3. **Backend Architect 2**: Stream C (file processing)
4. **Fullstack Developer**: Stream D (storage utilities)

### Success Metrics
- Can store and retrieve 500+ tracks efficiently
- Search returns results in <100ms
- Bulk upload of 50 files completes without UI freeze
- Storage quota warnings appear before limit reached
- Library export/import preserves all metadata and playlists
