## Overview

Implement comprehensive mix recording functionality that captures the DJ's live performance and exports it as high-quality audio files with metadata and social sharing capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Recording Features
- [ ] Implement MediaRecorder API for real-time audio capture
- [ ] Support multiple audio formats (MP3, WAV, OGG)
- [ ] Configurable audio quality settings (bitrate, sample rate)
- [ ] Real-time recording level meters and waveform display
- [ ] Start/stop/pause recording controls with keyboard shortcuts

### Export and Metadata
- [ ] Export mixes with embedded metadata (title, artist, date, duration)
- [ ] Automatic tracklist generation from played songs
- [ ] Timestamp markers for track transitions
- [ ] Mix artwork generation with track thumbnails
- [ ] Custom mix naming and tagging system

### Social Sharing Integration
- [ ] Direct upload to SoundCloud, Mixcloud APIs
- [ ] Generate shareable links with mix previews
- [ ] Social media sharing templates (Twitter, Instagram stories)
- [ ] QR code generation for easy mobile sharing
- [ ] Email sharing with downloadable links

### Storage and Management
- [ ] Local storage management with size limits
- [ ] Cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- [ ] Mix library with search and filtering
- [ ] Batch operations (delete, export, share multiple mixes)
- [ ] Recording history and statistics

## Technical Implementation

### Audio Processing Pipeline
```javascript
// MediaRecorder setup with high-quality settings
const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(audioStream, {
  mimeType: 'audio/webm;codecs=opus',
  audioBitsPerSecond: 320000
});

// Real-time audio analysis for levels
const analyser = audioContext.createAnalyser();
analyser.fftSize = 2048;
```

### Metadata Handling
```javascript
// Track metadata collection
const mixMetadata = {
  title: string,
  tracks: TrackInfo[],
  duration: number,
  timestamps: TransitionPoint[],
  artwork: ImageData
};
```

### Export System
```javascript
// Multi-format export with Web Workers
const exportMix = async (recording, format, quality) => {
  const worker = new Worker('./audio-encoder-worker.js');
  return worker.postMessage({ recording, format, quality });
};
```

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 20-24
- **Complexity**: High (audio processing, file handling, API integrations)

## Dependencies
- Task 003 (Audio playback engine with routing)
- Web Audio API MediaRecorder support
- Third-party audio encoding libraries (for MP3)
- Social platform API credentials

## Risk Factors
- Browser compatibility for MediaRecorder API
- Audio quality degradation during recording
- File size limitations for long mixes
- Social platform API rate limits

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- [ ] Recording quality matches original audio
- [ ] Export formats work across different devices
- [ ] Social sharing integrates with major platforms
- [ ] Performance testing with long recordings (2+ hours)
- [ ] Error handling for storage limits and network issues
- [ ] Documentation for recording best practices
