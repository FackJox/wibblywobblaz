## Overview
Implement comprehensive file management capabilities for the Decks application, including IndexedDB-based persistent storage for tracks, an intuitive track library UI, enhanced file upload functionality, and robust track metadata handling to provide DJs with efficient music library management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] IndexedDB integration for persistent track storage in browser
- [ ] Track library UI displays stored tracks with metadata
- [ ] File upload supports multiple audio formats (MP3, WAV, AAC, OGG)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop file upload functionality works smoothly
- [ ] Progress indicators show upload/processing status
- [ ] Track metadata extraction (title, artist, album, duration, BPM)
- [ ] Search and filter functionality within track library
- [ ] Track organization with playlists or folders
- [ ] Bulk file upload and processing capabilities
- [ ] Storage quota management and cleanup options
- [ ] Export/import library functionality for backup
- [ ] Track deletion with confirmation and cleanup

## Technical Requirements
- IndexedDB API for client-side storage with proper error handling
- File API for reading uploaded files and metadata
- Audio metadata parsing library integration
- Efficient data indexing for fast search and retrieval
- Storage quota monitoring and management
- Thumbnail/waveform preview generation and caching

## Implementation Notes
- Use Dexie.js or similar IndexedDB wrapper for easier database operations
- Implement progressive file processing to avoid blocking UI during bulk uploads
- Extract metadata using libraries like music-metadata or jsmediatags
- Store waveform data separately from audio files for performance
- Implement proper error handling for storage quota exceeded scenarios
- Use Web Workers for heavy file processing operations
- Consider compression for waveform data storage

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Hours**: 16-20 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium - database integration and file handling complexity

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Task 001 (Audio Foundation) for basic file handling
- Audio context and decoding capabilities must be established
- Can run in parallel with other tasks as it focuses on storage/UI

## Testing Strategy
- Database migration and schema testing
- File upload testing with various formats and sizes
- Storage quota testing with large libraries
- Search performance testing with hundreds of tracks
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for IndexedDB
- Data persistence testing across browser sessions
