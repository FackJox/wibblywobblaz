# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #6

## Overview
Establish the foundational Web Audio API infrastructure for the Decks application, including audio context management, playback controls, volume control, and file upload functionality. This is the critical foundation task that enables all other audio features.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core Audio Engine
**Scope**: Web Audio API context management, audio buffer handling, and playback logic
**Files**:
- `lib/audio/AudioManager.ts` - Core audio context management
- `lib/audio/AudioTrack.ts` - Individual track handling
- `lib/audio/types.ts` - Audio-related TypeScript types
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 6
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: File Upload & Processing
**Scope**: File upload UI, drag-and-drop, format validation, and decoding
**Files**:
- `components/decks/FileUpload.tsx` - Upload component
- `lib/audio/FileProcessor.ts` - File validation and decoding
- `lib/audio/formats.ts` - Format support utilities
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: UI Controls Integration
**Scope**: Transport controls and volume slider using existing components
**Files**:
- `components/decks/TransportControls.tsx` - Play/pause/stop buttons
- `components/decks/VolumeControl.tsx` - Volume slider wrapper
- `app/decks/page.tsx` - Basic page setup
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes (needs AudioManager API)
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: Stream A

### Stream D: Testing & Browser Compatibility
**Scope**: Unit tests, browser testing, error handling
**Files**:
- `__tests__/audio/AudioManager.test.ts`
- `__tests__/audio/FileProcessor.test.ts`
- `lib/audio/browserCompat.ts` - Browser compatibility utilities
**Agent Type**: fullstack-specialist
**Can Start**: after Streams A & B complete
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: Streams A, B

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- `lib/audio/types.ts` - Streams A & B (coordinate type definitions)
- `package.json` - Stream A (may need audio processing dependencies)

### Sequential Requirements
1. AudioManager API must be defined before UI controls can integrate
2. File processing needs to hand off to AudioManager for playback
3. Core functionality must exist before tests can be written

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams mostly work on different directories and files
- **Medium Risk**: Some coordination needed for shared types and API contracts
- **Minimal overlap**: Clean separation between audio engine, file handling, and UI

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Hybrid

Start Streams A & B immediately in parallel (no dependencies). Once Stream A completes, launch Stream C. Stream D begins when both A & B are done.

Timeline:
- Hour 0-6: Streams A & B run in parallel
- Hour 6-9: Stream C (depends on A)
- Hour 6-9: Stream D (can start testing completed streams)

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 9 hours
- Total work: 16 hours
- Efficiency gain: 44%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 16 hours

## Notes

### Critical Considerations
- Web Audio API requires user gesture for context activation - Stream A must handle this
- File size limits should be considered for browser memory - Stream B should implement chunking for large files
- Mobile Safari has specific Web Audio quirks - Stream D should test thoroughly
- Consider using Web Workers for audio decoding to prevent UI blocking

### Recommended Agent Assignments
1. **Backend Specialist**: Focus on Stream A (audio engine architecture)
2. **Frontend Specialist 1**: Handle Stream B (file upload/UX)
3. **Frontend Specialist 2**: Take Stream C after A completes
4. **QA/Fullstack**: Handle Stream D testing

### Success Metrics
- Audio playback works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop & mobile)
- Files up to 100MB can be loaded without browser crashes
- Latency between play button click and audio start < 100ms
- Volume changes are smooth without clicks/pops
