### Stream D: Mobile Optimization & Touch Interactions
**Agent**: `mobile-specialist` or `frontend-developer`
**Scope**: Mobile responsiveness, touch gestures, and performance optimization
**Files to create/modify**:
- `/components/decks/mobile/TouchGestureHandler.tsx`
- `/lib/mobile/touch-utils.ts`
- `/hooks/useTouchGestures.ts`
- CSS modifications in existing component files

**Can start**: After Stream A foundation (day 2)
**Estimated hours**: 4-6 hours

**Description**: Implement touch-friendly interactions, mobile-specific optimizations, and responsive design adjustments for visual feedback components.

### Stream E: Integration & Performance Layer
**Agent**: `performance-engineer` or `frontend-architect`
**Scope**: Component integration, performance optimization, and testing
**Files to create/modify**:
- `/components/decks/VisualFeedbackContainer.tsx`
- `/lib/performance/canvas-optimizer.ts`
- `/lib/performance/memory-manager.ts`
- Integration updates to existing deck components

**Can start**: After Streams A & B have core functionality (day 3-4)
**Estimated hours**: 6-8 hours

**Description**: Integrate all visual feedback components, implement performance optimizations (60fps, memory management), and ensure smooth coordination between systems.

## 3. Coordination Points

### Day 2-3: Interface Definition Sync
**Participants**: Streams A, B, C
**Purpose**: Align on data interfaces between waveform renderer, audio analyzer, and progress system
**Deliverables**: 
- Audio data format specifications
- Waveform data structure definitions
- Progress callback interfaces

### Day 4-5: Integration Checkpoint
**Participants**: All streams
**Purpose**: Integrate components and resolve any interface conflicts
**Deliverables**:
- Working integration of all components
- Performance baseline measurements
- Mobile compatibility verification

### Final Day: Testing & Polish
**Participants**: All streams
**Purpose**: Final integration testing and performance tuning
**Deliverables**:
- Performance test results
- Mobile device testing completion
- Final component integration

## 4. Conflict Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Stream A & B**: Different domains (visual vs audio processing)
- **Stream C**: Isolated UI components with well-defined interfaces

### Medium Risk
- **Stream D & A**: Potential mobile canvas rendering conflicts
  - **Mitigation**: Stream D waits for Stream A foundation
- **Stream E & All**: Integration dependencies
  - **Mitigation**: Staggered start after core streams establish interfaces

### High Risk
- **Performance optimization conflicts**: Multiple streams optimizing different aspects
  - **Mitigation**: Stream E owns all performance decisions with input from others

## 5. Parallelization Strategy

### Phase 1 (Days 1-2): Independent Development
- Streams A, B, C start simultaneously
- Focus on core functionality without integration concerns
- Establish clear interface contracts early

### Phase 2 (Days 3-4): Convergence & Mobile
- Stream D begins mobile optimization
- Stream E starts integration work
- Regular sync meetings for interface alignment

### Phase 3 (Days 5-6): Integration & Polish
- All streams converge on integration testing
- Performance optimization and bug fixes
- Mobile testing and final adjustments

## 6. Expected Timeline

### Without Parallelization: 28-32 hours (5-6 days)
- Day 1-2: Canvas waveform rendering (10 hours)
- Day 3-4: Audio analysis & BPM detection (12 hours) 
- Day 5: Progress & cue points (8 hours)
- Day 6: Mobile optimization & integration (6-8 hours)

### With Parallelization: 16-20 hours (3-4 days)
- **40-50% time savings through parallel execution**

### Parallel Execution Schedule:
```
Day 1: │ Stream A │ Stream B │ Stream C │           │           │
Day 2: │ Stream A │ Stream B │ Stream C │ Stream D  │           │
Day 3: │          │          │          │ Stream D  │ Stream E  │
Day 4: │                   Integration & Testing (All Streams)  │
```

## 7. Success Criteria for Parallel Execution

## 8. Recommended Agent Assignments

1. **Stream A**: Frontend developer with Canvas/WebGL experience
2. **Stream B**: Backend architect or specialist with audio processing knowledge
3. **Stream C**: Frontend developer with animation/real-time UI experience
4. **Stream D**: Mobile specialist or responsive design expert
5. **Stream E**: Senior frontend architect for integration oversight

This parallel approach reduces the timeline from 5-6 days to 3-4 days while maintaining code quality and avoiding conflicts through careful coordination and staggered starts.
