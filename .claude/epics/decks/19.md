## Overview

Optimize the Decks application for mobile devices with touch-friendly controls, iOS audio workarounds, responsive design improvements, and enhanced performance on resource-constrained devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Touch-Optimized Controls
- [ ] Larger touch targets for all interactive elements (minimum 44px)
- [ ] Custom touch gestures for deck controls (swipe, pinch, long-press)
- [ ] Virtual jog wheels with momentum and friction physics
- [ ] Touch-optimized crossfader with haptic feedback
- [ ] Multi-touch support for simultaneous controls
- [ ] Prevent accidental touches during mixing

### iOS Audio Workarounds
- [ ] iOS Web Audio API unlock implementation
- [ ] Background audio playback support
- [ ] iOS Safari audio buffer management
- [ ] Workaround for iOS audio context limitations
- [ ] Handle iOS audio session interruptions
- [ ] iOS-specific user gesture requirements

### Responsive Layout Refinements
- [ ] Mobile-first deck layout with stacked/tabbed views
- [ ] Collapsible sections for better screen real estate
- [ ] Portrait and landscape orientation support
- [ ] Adaptive UI based on screen size and device capabilities
- [ ] Mobile-optimized waveform display
- [ ] Touch-friendly track browser and search

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Reduced memory usage for mobile devices
- [ ] Optimized audio buffer sizes for mobile
- [ ] Lazy loading of non-critical components
- [ ] Service Worker for offline functionality
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- [ ] Battery usage optimization

## Technical Implementation

### Touch Event Handling
```javascript
// Advanced touch gesture recognition
class TouchGestureHandler {
  constructor(element) {
    this.element = element;
    this.touches = new Map();
    this.setupEventListeners();
  }
  
  handleTouchStart(event) {
    // Multi-touch tracking with gesture recognition
  }
}
```

### iOS Audio Context Management
```javascript
// iOS-specific audio unlock
const unlockAudioContext = async () => {
  if (audioContext.state === 'suspended') {
    await audioContext.resume();
  }
  // Play silent buffer to unlock
  const buffer = audioContext.createBuffer(1, 1, 22050);
  const source = audioContext.createBufferSource();
  source.buffer = buffer;
  source.connect(audioContext.destination);
  source.start();
};
```

### Responsive Layout System
```css
/* Mobile-first responsive design */
.deck-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "deck-a"
    "mixer"
    "deck-b";
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .deck-container {
    grid-template-areas: "deck-a mixer deck-b";
  }
}
```

### PWA Configuration
```javascript
// Service Worker for offline capabilities
const CACHE_NAME = 'decks-v1';
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/static/js/bundle.js',
  '/static/css/main.css'
];
```

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 18-22
- **Complexity**: High (mobile-specific challenges, performance optimization)

## Dependencies
- Task 002 (Real-time audio engine)
- Task 004 (Beatmatching and sync)
- Mobile device testing environment
- iOS and Android test devices

## Risk Factors
- iOS audio API limitations and changes
- Android fragmentation issues
- Performance variance across different mobile devices
- Touch event conflicts with audio processing

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] iPhone (multiple iOS versions)
- [ ] Android phones (various manufacturers)
- [ ] iPad and Android tablets
- [ ] Different screen sizes and pixel densities
- [ ] Various browser versions (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
- [ ] Performance testing on low-end devices

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- [ ] Touch controls feel natural and responsive
- [ ] Audio works reliably on iOS devices
- [ ] Performance is smooth on mid-range mobile devices
- [ ] PWA installs and works offline
- [ ] Battery drain is within acceptable limits
- [ ] All mobile-specific edge cases handled
- [ ] Documentation for mobile-specific features
