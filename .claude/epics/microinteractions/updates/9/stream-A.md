# Issue #9 - Stream A Progress

## Completed
- [x] Install framer-motion (already installed v11.18.2)
- [x] Create spring-transitions.tsx component with comprehensive motion wrappers
- [x] Replace CSS transitions in app/page.tsx with Framer Motion AnimatePresence
- [x] Implement spring physics configuration (damping: 30, stiffness: 300, mass: 0.8)
- [x] Add swipe gesture support for page navigation with velocity and threshold detection
- [x] Add loading state animations with pulsing dots and backdrop blur

## Current Status
✅ COMPLETED - All tasks implemented and tested

## Implementation Details
- **SpringPageTransition**: Main page wrapper with slide animations and gesture support
- **SpringContainer**: AnimatePresence wrapper for proper transition orchestration
- **SpringLoading**: Loading overlay with animated dots and smooth fade transitions
- **useSpringTransition**: Utility hook for managing page direction logic
- **Accessibility**: Respects prefers-reduced-motion with fallback to eased transitions
- **Performance**: Uses will-change-transform and proper touch-action for smooth gestures

## Technical Implementation
- Spring physics: realistic damping (30), stiffness (300), mass (0.8), rest thresholds
- Gesture detection: 50px swipe threshold, 500px/s velocity threshold
- Page transitions: slide in/out with opacity changes for smooth feel
- Loading states: scale and opacity animations with staggered dot pulses

## Build Status
✅ Build successful with no errors
✅ All components properly typed with TypeScript
✅ Transitions working smoothly in development
