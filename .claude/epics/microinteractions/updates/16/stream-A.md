# Issue #16 - Performance Optimization - Stream A Progress

## Stream A: Performance Profiling & Metrics

**Status**: Complete
**Agent**: frontend-developer
**Started**: 2025-09-10T13:00:00Z

### Scope
- Files: hooks/use-performance-monitor.ts, lib/performance-utils.ts, components/dev/performance-overlay.tsx, __tests__/performance/
- Work: Profiling, metrics collection, and monitoring setup

### Key Tasks
1. [x] Profile all existing animations (from Issues #3-14)
2. [x] Identify performance bottlenecks and document findings
3. [x] Enhance performance monitoring hook with detailed metrics
4. [x] Create performance overlay component for development
5. [x] Implement frame rate monitoring and reporting
6. [x] Write performance benchmark tests

### Progress Log

**2025-09-10T13:00:00Z - Initial Setup**
- Found existing `use-performance.tsx` hook from Issue #3
- Need to examine current implementation and enhance for comprehensive profiling
- Created progress tracking file

**2025-09-10T13:30:00Z - Performance Utils Implementation**
- Created comprehensive `lib/performance-utils.ts` with:
  - `AnimationProfiler` class for detailed performance tracking
  - Performance budgets for different animation types
  - Device detection utilities (low-end device detection)
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Jank score calculation and frame variance analysis
  - Performance benchmarking utilities

**2025-09-10T14:00:00Z - Enhanced Performance Monitor Hook**
- Created `hooks/use-performance-monitor.ts` with:
  - Extended performance metrics (fps, jank, memory, variance)
  - Performance issue detection and reporting
  - Configurable performance budgets by animation type
  - Real-time monitoring with issue callbacks
  - Performance score calculation (0-100)
  - Lightweight `useAnimationProfiler` for specific animations

**2025-09-10T14:30:00Z - Performance Overlay Component**
- Created `components/dev/performance-overlay.tsx` with:
  - Real-time performance metrics display
  - Expandable detailed view with frame timing
  - Performance issue notifications
  - Device information and capabilities
  - Interactive performance report generation
  - Compact `PerformanceIndicator` component

**2025-09-10T15:00:00Z - Comprehensive Test Suite**
- Created performance test suite in `__tests__/performance/`:
  - `performance-utils.test.ts` - Core utility testing
  - `use-performance-monitor.test.tsx` - Hook behavior testing
  - `animation-benchmarks.test.tsx` - All animation hooks benchmarking
  - `performance-overlay.test.tsx` - UI component testing
  - `profile-animations.test.ts` - Integration profiling tests

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Performance budgets: micro (60fps), scroll (60fps), hover (60fps), transition (30fps), complex (30fps)
- Low-end device detection based on CPU cores, memory, connection quality
- Jank score calculation (% of frames >16.67ms)
- Frame variance measurement for consistency
- Memory usage tracking and leak detection
- Comprehensive performance reporting with recommendations
- Real-time performance overlay for development debugging
- Automated performance benchmarking for all animation hooks
