# Task: Hover Enhancements

## Description
Create sophisticated hover interactions that respond to cursor movement and provide visual depth. Build a useMagneticHover hook for cursor attraction effects, add parallax depth to card components on hover, implement gradient follow effects that track mouse movement, and create text reveal animations on hover states. These enhancements create a more engaging and premium user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] useMagneticHover hook implemented with configurable attraction strength and boundaries
- [ ] Parallax depth effects added to card components with layered elements
- [ ] Gradient follow effects that smoothly track cursor movement across elements
- [ ] Text reveal animations triggered on hover with staggered character/word effects
- [ ] Hover state management prevents conflicts between multiple effects
- [ ] Performance optimized to maintain 60fps during cursor movement
- [ ] Touch device compatibility with appropriate fallbacks

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Use mouse event tracking, CSS transforms for magnetic effects, CSS gradients with dynamic positioning, create reusable hover enhancement hooks
- **Key files affected**:
  - `hooks/use-magnetic-hover.tsx` - New magnetic attraction hook
  - `hooks/use-gradient-follow.tsx` - New gradient tracking hook  
  - `hooks/use-text-reveal.tsx` - New text animation hook
  - `components/ui/card.tsx` - Add parallax and hover effects
  - `app/globals.css` - Add hover animation keyframes
  - `lib/hover-utils.ts` - Utility functions for cursor tracking and calculations
- **Code patterns to follow**: Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations, proper event listener cleanup, responsive design patterns

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3 (Animation Foundation) - Requires base animation infrastructure
- [ ] Existing Card and UI components
- [ ] Mouse/pointer event handling capabilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with proper performance optimization
- [ ] Tests written for all hover hooks and effects
- [ ] All card components have enhanced hover states
- [ ] Cursor tracking works smoothly across different screen sizes
- [ ] Touch device testing completed with appropriate fallbacks
- [ ] Performance profiling shows no memory leaks or excessive re-renders
