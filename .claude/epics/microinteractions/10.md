# Task: Scroll Animations

## Description
Implement scroll-triggered animations including a useStaggerReveal hook for list animations, Intersection Observer integration for scroll triggers, fade-in animations, and parallax scrolling effects for background elements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create useStaggerReveal hook for animating list items with staggered timing
- [ ] Implement Intersection Observer wrapper for efficient scroll trigger detection
- [ ] Add fade-in animations for content that enters viewport
- [ ] Create parallax scrolling effect for background elements
- [ ] Ensure animations are performant with proper throttling/debouncing
- [ ] Support reduced motion preferences
- [ ] Work smoothly on mobile devices

## Technical Details
- Build custom hooks leveraging framer-motion from task 3
- Use Intersection Observer API for performance
- Implement useScrollParallax and useStaggerReveal hooks
- Key files: `hooks/use-scroll-animations.ts`, `hooks/use-stagger-reveal.ts`, `hooks/use-parallax.ts`
- Apply to existing list components and background elements
- Follow React performance best practices

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3 (Animation Infrastructure) must be completed
- [ ] Intersection Observer API support
- [ ] Existing scrollable content areas identified

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Custom hooks implemented and tested
- [ ] Scroll animations working across different viewport sizes
- [ ] Performance optimized with proper cleanup
- [ ] Tests written for all animation hooks
- [ ] Documentation for hook usage created
- [ ] Applied to at least 2 existing components
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
