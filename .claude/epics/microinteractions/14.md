- [ ] Digital noise overlay effects for loading states
- [ ] All glitch effects respect user's motion preferences
- [ ] Effects integrate seamlessly with existing theme system
- [ ] Performance optimized for smooth 60fps operation

## Technical Details
- Create `hooks/use-glitch.ts` with multiple glitch variants
- Implement CSS-in-JS or CSS modules for complex visual effects
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
