# Task: Page Transitions Enhancement

## Description
Enhance the existing slide transitions between "Links" and "Parties" views with spring physics animations. Add loading state animations and implement smooth page exit/enter transitions with proper orchestration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace basic slide transitions with spring physics-based animations
- [ ] Implement loading state animations for page transitions
- [ ] Add smooth page exit animations that complete before enter animations begin
- [ ] Create transition orchestration system to manage multiple animation states
- [ ] Ensure animations are performant and don't block user interactions
- [ ] Add proper cleanup for animation resources

## Technical Details
- Build upon the framer-motion infrastructure from task 3
- Enhance existing slide transitions in `app/page.tsx`
- Use spring physics with realistic damping and stiffness values
- Implement AnimationController pattern for orchestration
- Key files: `app/page.tsx`, `components/ui/transitions.tsx` (new)
- Follow existing animation patterns in the codebase

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3 (Animation Infrastructure) must be completed
- [ ] Framer Motion library available and configured
- [ ] Existing page navigation system in place

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and integrated with existing navigation
- [ ] Spring physics animations working smoothly
- [ ] Loading states properly animated
- [ ] Tests written for animation components
- [ ] Performance tested on mobile devices
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
