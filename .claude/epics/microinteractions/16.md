# Task: Performance Optimization

## Description
Conduct comprehensive performance optimization of all microinteraction animations to ensure consistent 60fps performance across devices. This final optimization pass will profile existing animations, implement strategic performance hints, add lazy loading, and establish monitoring systems for ongoing performance tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All animations consistently achieve 60fps on target devices
- [ ] Strategic will-change CSS hints applied to animated elements
- [ ] Lazy loading implemented for non-critical animation hooks
- [ ] Feature flags system for toggling animation groups
- [ ] Bundle size impact monitored and optimized
- [ ] Performance metrics collection integrated
- [ ] Animation performance tests written and passing
- [ ] Performance regression detection in CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Details
- Use browser DevTools and React Profiler for performance analysis
- Implement `usePerformanceMonitor` hook for runtime metrics
- Add will-change hints only when animations are active
- Create lazy-loaded wrappers for heavy animation hooks
- Implement feature flags using context or environment variables
- Add webpack bundle analyzer integration
- Use intersection observer for viewport-based optimizations
- Implement animation frame budgeting for complex sequences

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous microinteraction tasks (3-14) completed
- [ ] Access to target device testing environment
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools configured
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline access for regression testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance audit completed with documented results
- [ ] All animations optimized for 60fps target
- [ ] will-change hints strategically implemented
- [ ] Lazy loading system functional for animation hooks
- [ ] Feature flags operational for animation control
- [ ] Bundle size impact documented and acceptable
- [ ] Performance monitoring integrated and operational
- [ ] Comprehensive performance test suite written
- [ ] Performance regression detection active in CI/CD
- [ ] Final performance report generated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] All optimizations deployed to staging environment
