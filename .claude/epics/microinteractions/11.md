# Task: Mobile Gestures

## Description
Implement mobile-first gesture interactions including swipe navigation between pages, long-press context actions, comprehensive touch event handling, and haptic feedback support where available.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement swipe gestures for navigating between "Links" and "Parties" views
- [ ] Add long-press context actions for interactive elements
- [ ] Create robust touch event handling system with proper preventDefault logic
- [ ] Integrate haptic feedback using Vibration API where supported
- [ ] Ensure gestures work smoothly alongside existing click handlers
- [ ] Add visual feedback for gesture recognition (e.g., swipe indicators)
- [ ] Support gesture preferences and accessibility settings

## Technical Details
- Build upon animation infrastructure and enhanced page transitions
- Use React touch event handlers with proper touch point tracking
- Implement gesture recognition with configurable thresholds
- Key files: `hooks/use-gestures.ts`, `components/ui/gesture-wrapper.tsx`, `utils/haptics.ts`
- Integrate with existing page transition system from task 9
- Use modern Web APIs: Touch Events, Vibration API
- Follow mobile UX best practices

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3 (Animation Infrastructure) must be completed
- [ ] Task 9 (Page Transitions Enhancement) must be completed
- [ ] Touch Events API support
- [ ] Vibration API support (progressive enhancement)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Swipe navigation fully functional on mobile devices
- [ ] Long-press actions implemented with proper timing
- [ ] Touch event system handles edge cases (multi-touch, interruptions)
- [ ] Haptic feedback working where supported
- [ ] Comprehensive testing on various mobile devices
- [ ] Tests written for gesture recognition logic
- [ ] Accessibility considerations addressed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
