# Issue #11: Mobile Gestures - Parallel Work Analysis

## Overview
Implement mobile-first gesture interactions including swipe navigation, long-press actions, touch handling, and haptic feedback.

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Core Gesture System & Swipe Navigation
**Agent Type**: frontend-developer
**Scope**: Foundation gesture detection and swipe between pages
**Files**:
- `hooks/use-gestures.ts` (new) - Core gesture detection hook
- `hooks/use-swipe.ts` (new) - Swipe gesture specific logic
- `app/page.tsx` (modify) - Integrate swipe navigation with existing page transitions
- `lib/gesture-utils.ts` (new) - Gesture calculation utilities

**Work**:
1. Create gesture detection system with touch event tracking
2. Implement swipe direction detection with velocity calculation
3. Configure thresholds for swipe recognition (distance, velocity)
4. Integrate with existing page transition system
5. Add gesture state management (tracking, in-progress, completed)
6. Implement gesture cancellation logic

### Stream B: Long-Press & Touch Interactions
**Agent Type**: frontend-developer
**Scope**: Long-press actions and enhanced touch handling
**Files**:
- `hooks/use-long-press.ts` (new) - Long-press detection hook
- `components/ui/gesture-wrapper.tsx` (new) - Wrapper component for gesture-enabled elements
- `components/ui/touch-feedback.tsx` (new) - Visual feedback components

**Work**:
1. Create long-press detection with configurable duration
2. Implement visual feedback for long-press (ripple/scale effect)
3. Build gesture wrapper component for reusable gesture handling
4. Add touch feedback animations
5. Handle multi-touch scenarios and edge cases
6. Create context menu system for long-press actions

### Stream C: Haptic Feedback & Mobile UX
**Agent Type**: frontend-developer
**Scope**: Haptic integration and mobile-specific optimizations
**Files**:
- `lib/haptics.ts` (new) - Haptic feedback utilities
- `hooks/use-haptics.ts` (new) - Haptic feedback hook
- `components/ui/swipe-indicators.tsx` (new) - Visual swipe indicators

**Work**:
1. Implement Vibration API wrapper with fallbacks
2. Create haptic patterns for different interactions
3. Build swipe indicators UI component
4. Add gesture hints/tutorials for first-time users
5. Implement gesture accessibility settings
6. Add performance optimizations for smooth 60fps gestures

## Dependencies Between Streams
- Streams A and B can work in parallel initially
- Stream C depends partially on A and B for integration points
- Final integration requires all streams to coordinate

## Risk Mitigation
- Test on multiple devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
- Handle cases where Vibration API is not available
- Ensure gestures don't conflict with native browser gestures
- Maintain accessibility for non-gesture navigation

## Success Criteria
- All gestures work smoothly at 60fps
- No conflicts with existing click handlers
- Graceful degradation when APIs unavailable
- Passes accessibility audit
