# Task: Animation Foundation

## Description
Establish the core animation infrastructure for the microinteractions system. This includes setting up Tailwind animation configuration with custom keyframes, creating base animation utilities and CSS variables, implementing performance monitoring hooks, and adding prefers-reduced-motion support. This is the foundation task that all other microinteraction tasks depend on.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Custom Tailwind keyframes configured in tailwind.config.js for common animations (pulse, bounce, scale, fade)
- [ ] CSS variables added to globals.css for animation timings and easings
- [ ] Base animation utility classes created for consistent timing and easing
- [ ] Performance monitoring hook (useAnimationPerformance) implemented to track frame rates
- [ ] Prefers-reduced-motion detection and handling implemented
- [ ] Animation state management utilities created (useAnimationState)
- [ ] Documentation for animation system created in components

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Extend existing Tailwind config and globals.css, create custom hooks
- **Key files affected**: 
  - `tailwind.config.js` - Add custom keyframes and animation utilities
  - `app/globals.css` - Add CSS variables and base animation classes
  - `hooks/use-animation.tsx` - New hook for animation state management
  - `hooks/use-performance.tsx` - New hook for performance monitoring
  - `lib/animation-utils.ts` - Utility functions for animation helpers
- **Code patterns to follow**: Follow existing hook patterns, use TypeScript interfaces, implement proper cleanup

## Dependencies
- [ ] No task dependencies (foundation task)
- [ ] Tailwind CSS already configured
- [ ] Next.js 15 App Router structure
- [ ] Existing hooks pattern in codebase

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and follows existing patterns
- [ ] Tests written for all hooks and utilities
- [ ] Animation system documented with examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Accessibility (reduced motion) testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed for performance implications
