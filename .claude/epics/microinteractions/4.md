# Task: Ripple and Click Interactions

## Description
Implement tactile feedback for user interactions through ripple effects and click animations. Create a reusable useRipple hook for click/tap feedback, add ripple effects to buttons and interactive elements, implement micro-bounce feedback on successful actions, and add scale/opacity transitions on clicks. This enhances the user experience by providing immediate visual feedback for interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] useRipple hook created with customizable ripple effects (color, size, duration)
- [ ] Ripple effects applied to all Button components and interactive elements
- [ ] Micro-bounce animations implemented for successful actions (form submissions, saves)
- [ ] Click scale/opacity transitions added to clickable components
- [ ] Touch-friendly ripple effects optimized for mobile devices
- [ ] Ripple animation cleanup properly handles rapid clicks
- [ ] Performance optimization ensures smooth 60fps animations

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Create reusable hook with event listeners, use CSS animations for ripples, integrate with existing button components
- **Key files affected**:
  - `hooks/use-ripple.tsx` - New ripple effect hook
  - `components/ui/button.tsx` - Add ripple integration
  - `components/ui/` - Update other interactive components
  - `app/globals.css` - Add ripple animation keyframes
  - `lib/ripple-utils.ts` - Utility functions for ripple calculations
- **Code patterns to follow**: Use existing component patterns, proper event handling, cleanup on unmount

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3 (Animation Foundation) - Requires base animation infrastructure
- [ ] Existing Button and UI components
- [ ] Touch event handling capabilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Tests written for useRipple hook and integrations
- [ ] All interactive components have ripple effects
- [ ] Mobile touch interactions tested and optimized
- [ ] Performance testing shows no frame drops during animations
- [ ] Accessibility tested with screen readers and keyboard navigation
