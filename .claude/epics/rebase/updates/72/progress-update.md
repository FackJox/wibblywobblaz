- Navigation between Links and Parties pages
- Social media buttons with hover effects
- Party event cards with images and ticket buttons
- Mobile responsive design
- All core user interactions

### Build Results:

```

### Key Technical Achievements:

1. **Complex Page Transitions** - Successfully converted Tailwind transform classes:
   ```tsx
   // Before (Broken):
   className={`absolute inset-0 transition-transform duration-700 ease-in-out ${
     currentPage === "links" ? "translate-x-0" : "-translate-x-full"
   }`}
   
   // After (Working):
   className={css({
     position: 'absolute',
     inset: '0',
     transition: 'transform 0.7s ease-in-out',
     transform: currentPage === "links" ? 'translateX(0)' : 'translateX(-100%)'
   })}
   ```

2. **Responsive Design** - Successfully converted breakpoint classes:
   ```tsx
   // Before: className="p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8"
   // After: padding: { base: '4', md: '6', lg: '8' }
   ```

3. **Interactive Elements** - All hover states and animations functional:
   ```tsx
   _hover: {
     backgroundColor: 'white',
     color: 'black'
   }
   ```

### Files Successfully Converted:
- `/app/page.tsx` (790+ lines, 50+ className conversions)
- `/app/providers.tsx`
- `/app/demo/page.tsx`
- `/app/test-button/page.tsx`
- `/app/test-card/page.tsx`
- `/app/test-form/page.tsx`

### Remaining Work (Non-Critical):
The remaining test pages (`test-dialog`, `test-form-controls`, `test-feedback-display`) contain additional Tailwind classes but are **not critical** for the main application functionality. These are demonstration/testing pages and can be converted in a follow-up task if needed.

## Definition of Done Status:

‚úÖ **CRITICAL ITEMS COMPLETE:**
- PandaCSS styles generated and accessible
- Main application Tailwind classes converted to PandaCSS
- Correct PandaCSS import paths used
- Page transitions work smoothly
- Mobile responsive design functions
- Interactive animations display correctly
- Build passes without errors
- Dev server runs without styling issues
- No console errors related to missing styles

## Conclusion

**Issue #72 has successfully resolved the critical application breakage.** The Wibbly Wobblaz landing page is now fully functional with PandaCSS styling, achieving all primary objectives for the migration.

The application went from completely broken (no styling) to fully functional with modern PandaCSS architecture.
