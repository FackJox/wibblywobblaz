## Current Status: IN_PROGRESS
**Started:** 2025-09-14T22:25:00Z

## Analysis Phase Complete

### Current State:
- **Current Branch:** epic/rebase  
- **Target Branch:** main
- **Base Commit:** 1268cb27b74744e343152dfeed9e84ac50ed8a86
- **Commits to Rebase:** 17 commits total (5 from original migration + 12 from our hook conversions)

### Main Branch Changes Since Divergence:
- 26 commits including microinteractions epic completion
- Bundle optimization improvements  
- Feature flag system implementation
- Performance monitoring system
- Haptic feedback and mobile UX
- Animation optimizations
- TypeScript and ESLint fixes

### Our Changes to Preserve:
- Complete PandaCSS migration infrastructure
- Hook conversions from Issues #64-67:
  - use-mobile.tsx ‚Üí PandaCSS
  - use-feature-flags.tsx ‚Üí PandaCSS  
  - use-haptics.ts ‚Üí PandaCSS
  - Complex animation hooks ‚Üí PandaCSS
  - Dynamic style hooks ‚Üí PandaCSS
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Updated documentation

## Rebase Strategy:
1. **Fetch latest main** to ensure we have all changes
2. **Interactive rebase** onto main to carefully handle conflicts
3. **Prioritize PandaCSS** implementations over Tailwind in conflicts
4. **Preserve all hook conversions** from our work
5. **Maintain package.json dependencies** for PandaCSS
6. **Test build** after each major conflict resolution
