# Stream C Progress: Conversion Mapping Document

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Document Analysis
- ✅ Reviewed requirements from Issue #64
- ✅ Analyzed Stream A and B outputs
- ✅ Examined PandaCSS patterns from research files
- ✅ Retrieved and analyzed key animation hooks from main branch

### 2. Hook Analysis
- ✅ Categorized all 19 hooks by complexity:
  - Simple Utility: use-mobile, use-feature-flags, use-haptics
  - Dynamic Style: use-ripple, use-magnetic-hover, use-gradient-follow  
  - Complex Animation: use-parallax, use-scroll-animations, use-stagger-reveal, use-text-reveal
  - DOM Management: use-animation, use-batched-dom, use-gestures, use-long-press, use-swipe, use-performance-monitor, use-performance, use-toast

### 3. Conversion Mapping Creation
- ✅ Created comprehensive mapping document at `.claude/epics/rebase/conversion-mapping.md`
- ✅ Documented detailed conversion strategies for 6 representative hooks
- ✅ Provided reusable conversion templates
- ✅ Included performance optimization patterns
- ✅ Added testing strategies and validation checklist

### 4. Implementation Planning
- ✅ Organized conversion work into 4 phases
- ✅ Mapped phases to Issues #65, #66, #67
- ✅ Provided implementation priority order
- ✅ Created validation framework

## Key Deliverables

### Conversion Strategies
1. **State-Driven CSS Generation** - Replace ref manipulation with React state
2. **CVA for Multi-State Components** - Use Class Variance Authority for complex state management
3. **CSS Custom Properties** - Dynamic values through CSS variables
4. **Performance-Optimized Transforms** - Hardware acceleration patterns

### Sample Conversions
- `use-ripple.tsx` → State-managed ripple effects with CSS animations
- `use-parallax.tsx` → Intersection observer + transform-based scrolling
- `use-stagger-reveal.tsx` → CVA variants + setTimeout-based staggering
- `use-magnetic-hover.tsx` → Mouse-following transforms with throttling
- `use-mobile.tsx` → CSS-first responsive patterns
- `use-feature-flags.tsx` → Context + visual state management

### Reusable Patterns
- Basic animation hook template
- Intersection-triggered animation template
- Performance budgeting utilities
- Accessibility compliance patterns

## Technical Insights

### PandaCSS Strengths
- Runtime CSS generation with `css()` function
- Type-safe styling with CVA
- Design token integration
- Performance optimization capabilities

### Conversion Challenges Addressed
- Dynamic keyframe generation limitations
- Complex animation sequencing
- Performance optimization requirements
- State management complexity

### Performance Considerations
- Hardware acceleration with `translate3d()`
- Conditional `will-change` usage
- Intersection observer optimization
- Animation budgeting strategies

## Implementation Readiness

### Phase Breakdown
- **Phase 1**: Simple utility hooks (Issues #65 start)
- **Phase 2**: Dynamic style hooks (Issues #65 completion)
- **Phase 3**: Complex animation hooks (Issue #66)
- **Phase 4**: DOM management hooks (Issue #67)

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive testing strategies defined
- Performance validation framework created
- Accessibility compliance requirements specified
- Cross-browser compatibility considerations included

## Next Actions

The conversion mapping document is complete and ready to guide the actual implementation work in Issues #65, #66, and #67. Each implementation phase has:

1. Clear conversion strategies
2. Code examples and templates
3. Performance optimization guidelines
4. Testing requirements
5. Validation criteria

The document serves as the definitive reference for converting all 19 animation hooks to PandaCSS patterns while maintaining performance and functionality.
