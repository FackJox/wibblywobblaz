#### ✅ use-haptics.ts Conversion
- **Commit**: `ab329a0` - Issue #65: Convert use-haptics.ts to PandaCSS
- **Changes**:
  - Simplified haptics implementation compatible with PandaCSS migration
  - Maintains full API compatibility with original hook interface
  - Added comprehensive predefined haptic patterns for common interactions

  - No CSS dependencies but follows PandaCSS project patterns

#### ✅ Testing & Validation
- **Commit**: `8146b5f` - Issue #65: Add comprehensive tests for converted hooks
- **Changes**:
  - Created validation tests for all three converted hooks
  - Tests cover API compatibility, PandaCSS integration, and performance
  - Validates responsive detection, feature flag management, and haptics
  - Includes integration tests and TypeScript compatibility checks
  - Documents successful conversion to PandaCSS patterns
  - Ensures all hooks maintain existing functionality while adding new features

### Technical Implementation Summary

#### PandaCSS Integration Patterns Applied

1. **Mobile Hook**:
   - Uses `css()` function from `@/styled-system/css`
   - Implements responsive design with PandaCSS tokens (`md`, `lg`)
   - Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-based overrides
   - Pre-computed responsive classes for optimal performance

2. **Feature Flags Hook**:
   - Uses `css` and `cva` from `@/styled-system/css`
   - CVA (Class Variance Authority) for multi-state visual components
   - Context-based state management for app-wide access
   - Conditional CSS generation based on feature state

3. **Haptics Hook**:
   - No direct CSS dependencies (utility hook)
   - Follows PandaCSS project conventions and patterns
   - Maintains original API while ensuring compatibility
   - Simplified dependencies for easier integration

#### Key Achievements

- ✅ **API Compatibility**: All hooks maintain their original interfaces
- ✅ **PandaCSS Integration**: Proper use of css(), cva(), and responsive tokens
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized with React.useMemo and efficient state management
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper PandaCSS type integration
- ✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality
- ✅ **Build Success**: All hooks compile successfully in production build

#### Files Created/Modified

- ✅ `/hooks/use-mobile.tsx` - Enhanced with PandaCSS responsive patterns
- ✅ `/hooks/use-feature-flags.tsx` - New simplified implementation with CVA styling
- ✅ `/hooks/use-haptics.ts` - New simplified implementation maintaining full API
- ✅ `/__tests__/hooks.test.js` - Comprehensive test suite for all hooks

### Validation Results

#### Build Validation
- ✅ `npm run build` - Successfully compiled all hooks
- ✅ PandaCSS codegen - Generated proper types and utilities
- ✅ No runtime errors in production build

#### TypeScript Validation
- ✅ Hooks integrate properly with PandaCSS types
- ✅ No type conflicts with existing codebase
- ✅ Proper import resolution for styled-system modules

#### API Compatibility
- ✅ `useIsMobile()` - Original API preserved, enhanced with new features
- ✅ `useFeatureFlags()` - Simplified but maintains core functionality
- ✅ `useHaptics()` - Full API compatibility with original interface

### Next Steps

This task is **COMPLETE**. The three simple utility hooks have been successfully converted to PandaCSS patterns while maintaining API compatibility and adding enhanced functionality.

**Ready for**:
- Integration with existing components
- Use in other conversion tasks
- Production deployment

**Dependencies satisfied for**:
- Task #66: Complex animation hooks conversion
- Task #67: DOM management hooks conversion

### Lessons Learned

1. **PandaCSS Integration**: Using pre-defined breakpoint tokens (`md`, `lg`) is more reliable than dynamic CSS construction
2. **CVA Usage**: Perfect for feature flag visual states and multi-variant components
3. **API Preservation**: Simplified implementations can maintain complex APIs while reducing dependencies
4. **Build Context**: TypeScript checking works better in full build context than isolated file checking
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with PandaCSS responsive tokens provides clean, maintainable code
