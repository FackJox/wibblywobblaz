## Current Status: COMPLETE ✅

### Analysis Complete ✅

- [x] Found tailwind config file to remove
- [x] Confirmed PostCSS already updated for PandaCSS  
- [x] Found no @tailwind directives in globals.css
- [x] Identified files using tailwind-merge and cn() function

### Packages to Remove
- [x] tailwindcss (dev dependency)
- [x] tailwind-merge (dependency)

### Files to Remove/Update
