# Task 69 - Remove Tailwind and update build

## Description

Complete removal of Tailwind CSS dependencies, configuration files, and build system integration while ensuring PandaCSS build pipeline is properly configured and optimized.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Remove all Tailwind CSS packages from package.json
- [ ] Delete tailwind.config.js and related configuration files
- [ ] Update PostCSS configuration to work with PandaCSS only
- [ ] Remove Tailwind imports from CSS files
- [ ] Update build scripts to exclude Tailwind processing
- [ ] Verify build performance improvements
- [ ] Ensure no Tailwind-related errors in build output

## Technical Details

### Activities

**Package Removal:**
- Remove `tailwindcss` package
- Remove `@tailwindcss/typography` (if present)
- Remove `autoprefixer` if only used for Tailwind
- Clean up any Tailwind-related dev dependencies

**Configuration Updates:**
- Delete `tailwind.config.js`
- Update `postcss.config.js` to remove Tailwind plugin
- Remove Tailwind directives from CSS files (`@tailwind base`, etc.)
- Update any build scripts referencing Tailwind

**Build System:**
- Verify PandaCSS build integration
- Test build performance and output size
- Ensure CSS generation works correctly
- Validate production build optimization

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- Task 68: Execute rebase and resolve conflicts

**Reasoning:** Requires successful rebase completion to ensure we're working with the final codebase state before removing Tailwind infrastructure.

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** M (3-4 hours)

**Breakdown:**
- Package and config removal: 1 hour
- Build system updates: 1-2 hours
- Testing and verification: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [ ] No Tailwind packages in package.json
- [ ] No Tailwind configuration files remain
- [ ] PostCSS config updated and working
- [ ] Build completes without Tailwind-related errors
- [ ] CSS output contains only PandaCSS styles
- [ ] Build performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] All components still render correctly
- [ ] No console warnings about missing Tailwind classes
