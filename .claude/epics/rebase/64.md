# Task 64: Analyze and map animation hooks

## Description

Analyze main branch animation hooks and create mapping to PandaCSS patterns. This foundational task involves examining all deleted animation hooks to understand their functionality, dependencies, and conversion requirements for PandaCSS integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete analysis of all 19 deleted animation hooks
- [ ] Document current hook functionality and dependencies
- [ ] Identify PandaCSS conversion patterns for each hook type
- [ ] Create conversion mapping document
- [ ] Test PandaCSS runtime compatibility with animation patterns
- [ ] Validate that PandaCSS can handle dynamic style generation

## Technical Details

### Hooks to Analyze
- use-animation.tsx
- use-batched-dom.ts
- use-feature-flags.tsx
- use-gestures.ts
- use-gradient-follow.tsx
- use-haptics.ts
- use-long-press.ts
- use-magnetic-hover.tsx
- use-mobile.tsx
- use-parallax.tsx
- use-performance-monitor.ts
- use-performance.tsx
- use-ripple.tsx
- use-scroll-animations.tsx
- use-stagger-reveal.tsx
- use-swipe.ts
- use-text-reveal.tsx
- use-toast.ts

### Analysis Requirements
1. Document each hook's purpose and functionality
2. Identify CSS generation patterns (inline styles, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind classes)
3. Map to equivalent PandaCSS patterns (css(), cva(), recipes)
4. Note any runtime performance considerations
5. Identify shared utilities and common patterns

### PandaCSS Integration Points
- Runtime CSS generation with css() function
- Dynamic class generation with conditional patterns
- Animation keyframes and transitions
- Responsive and state-based styling
- Performance optimization strategies

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundational analysis task.

## Effort Estimate

**Size: S (2-3 hours)**

- 1 hour: Hook analysis and documentation
- 1 hour: PandaCSS pattern research and testing
- 0.5-1 hour: Mapping document creation and validation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All hooks analyzed and documented
- [ ] PandaCSS conversion patterns identified and tested
- [ ] Mapping document created with clear conversion strategies
- [ ] Runtime compatibility validated
- [ ] Ready to guide subsequent conversion tasks
