# Task 68 - Execute rebase and resolve conflicts

## Description

Perform git rebase of PandaCSS migration onto main branch, handling all merge conflicts and ensuring a clean integration of the migration changes with the latest main branch state.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successfully rebase PandaCSS migration branch onto latest main
- [ ] Resolve all merge conflicts properly maintaining PandaCSS changes
- [ ] Verify all commits are preserved and properly ordered
- [ ] Ensure build passes after rebase completion
- [ ] Validate that no functionality is lost during conflict resolution
- [ ] Confirm all PandaCSS configurations remain intact

## Technical Details

### Key Activities
- Interactive rebase execution (`git rebase -i main`)
- Conflict resolution for:
  - Package.json dependencies
  - Configuration files (panda.config.ts, tailwind.config.js removal)
  - Component files with styling changes
  - Build scripts and tooling
- Commit verification and history validation
- Build system testing post-rebase

### Expected Conflicts
- Package dependencies (PandaCSS vs existing packages)
- Configuration file changes
- Component styling implementations
- Build configuration updates

### Resolution Strategy
- Prioritize PandaCSS implementations over Tailwind
- Maintain existing component APIs while updating styling
- Preserve build optimizations from both branches
- Keep migration-specific tooling and scripts

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- Task 65: Component migration analysis and planning
- Task 66: Hook cleanup and PandaCSS integration 
- Task 67: Build system configuration updates

**Reasoning:** Requires completion of analysis, cleanup, and configuration work before attempting rebase to minimize conflicts and ensure smooth integration.

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** L (6-8 hours)

**Breakdown:**
- Rebase execution: 2 hours
- Conflict resolution: 3-4 hours
- Testing and verification: 1-2 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Rebase completed successfully with clean history
- [ ] All merge conflicts resolved appropriately
- [ ] Build system works without errors
- [ ] All tests pass (if any exist)
- [ ] PandaCSS styling system fully functional
- [ ] No Tailwind CSS remnants causing conflicts
- [ ] Git history is clean and logical
- [ ] Documentation updated for any conflict resolution decisions
