# Task 67: Convert complex animation hooks

## Description

Convert parallax, scroll-animations, stagger-reveal, text-reveal, and remaining complex animation hooks to PandaCSS. These hooks represent the most sophisticated animation patterns requiring advanced PandaCSS techniques for scroll-based animations, gesture handling, and performance monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Convert all remaining complex animation hooks to PandaCSS
- [ ] Maintain scroll-based animation performance
- [ ] Preserve gesture recognition and handling
- [ ] Ensure stagger and reveal animations work smoothly
- [ ] Maintain performance monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for all animation scenarios
- [ ] Validate performance across different devices
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance for animations

## Technical Details

### Hooks to Convert

**Animation Hooks**
- use-parallax.tsx - Scroll-based parallax effects
- use-scroll-animations.tsx - Scroll-triggered animations
- use-stagger-reveal.tsx - Sequential reveal animations
- use-text-reveal.tsx - Text animation effects
- use-animation.tsx - General animation utilities

**Interaction Hooks**
- use-gestures.ts - Touch and mouse gesture recognition
- use-swipe.ts - Swipe gesture handling
- use-long-press.ts - Long press interaction

**Performance Hooks**
- use-performance.tsx - Performance tracking
- use-performance-monitor.ts - Real-time performance monitoring
- use-batched-dom.ts - Optimized DOM operations

### Complex Requirements

1. **Scroll-Based Animations**
   - Intersection Observer integration
   - Smooth scroll progress tracking
   - Performance-optimized transform calculations
   - Responsive behavior across viewports

2. **Gesture Recognition**
   - Touch event handling with PandaCSS
   - Multi-touch gesture support
   - Gesture state management
   - Accessibility considerations

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Frame rate tracking with PandaCSS animations
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Animation performance metrics
   - Debugging and profiling tools

4. **Stagger and Reveal Effects**
   - Sequential animation orchestration
   - Timing coordination across elements
   - Dynamic delay calculations
   - Interrupt and resume handling

### PandaCSS Advanced Patterns
- Complex css() function usage with animations
- CSS variable manipulation for smooth transitions
- Keyframe animation integration
- Transform optimization
- GPU acceleration patterns

## Dependencies

- **Task 64**: Analysis and mapping must be complete to guide complex animation patterns

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (4-5 hours)**

- 2.5 hours: Core animation hook conversion
- 1 hour: Gesture and interaction hook conversion
- 0.5 hour: Performance hook conversion
- 0.5-1 hour: Integration testing and performance validation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All complex animation hooks converted to PandaCSS
- [ ] Scroll-based animations performing smoothly
- [ ] Gesture recognition working correctly
- [ ] Performance monitoring integrated
- [ ] Stagger and reveal effects functioning
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Accessibility standards maintained
- [ ] Ready for production deployment
