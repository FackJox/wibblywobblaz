# Task 70 - Test animations and fix regressions

## Description

Comprehensive testing of all animations, transitions, and interactive elements to ensure they work correctly with PandaCSS and fix any regressions introduced during the migration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All existing animations work as expected
- [ ] Custom keyframe animations are properly migrated
- [ ] Transition effects on hover/focus states work correctly
- [ ] Mobile animations and gestures function properly
- [ ] Performance of animations is maintained or improved
- [ ] No visual glitches or broken animations
- [ ] All interactive components respond correctly

## Technical Details

### Activities

**Visual Testing:**
- Test all page animations and transitions
- Verify hover effects on buttons and interactive elements
- Check mobile slide transitions and navigation
- Validate custom keyframe animations in `globals.css`
- Test theme switching animations

**Performance Testing:**
- Measure animation frame rates
- Check for layout thrashing
- Verify smooth scrolling performance
- Test on different devices and browsers

**Regression Fixes:**
- Fix any broken animation timing
- Resolve CSS property conflicts
- Update animation class names if needed
- Optimize performance bottlenecks

### Known Animation Areas
- Page slide transitions (Links â†” Parties)
- Button hover and focus effects
- Mobile menu animations
- Custom keyframes in globals.css
- Theme transition effects

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- Task 69: Remove Tailwind and update build

**Reasoning:** Requires complete Tailwind removal to test final animation state without interference from conflicting CSS systems.

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** M (4-5 hours)

**Breakdown:**
- Comprehensive testing: 2-3 hours
- Regression identification: 1 hour
- Fixes and optimization: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All animations work smoothly and correctly
- [ ] No visual regressions from Tailwind migration
- [ ] Animation performance meets or exceeds previous state
- [ ] Mobile animations work on actual devices
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] All interactive elements respond appropriately
- [ ] Custom animations maintained from original design
- [ ] No console errors related to animations
