## Description

Comprehensive testing and optimization phase to ensure the PandaCSS migration maintains visual consistency, performance standards, and cross-browser compatibility. This includes visual regression testing, performance benchmarking, and thorough validation across all supported devices and browsers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Visual regression tests pass across all viewport sizes (320px-1920px)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed current Tailwind implementation
- [ ] Bundle size analysis shows optimal or improved metrics
- [ ] Fluid scaling works correctly without text wrapping issues
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

## Technical Details

### Visual Regression Testing
- Set up automated visual testing with tools like Percy or Chromatic
- Test all component states and interactive elements
- Verify responsive breakpoints and fluid scaling
- Document any visual differences and ensure they're intentional

### Performance Benchmarking
- Measure bundle size before/after migration
- Analyze CSS parsing and rendering performance
- Test page load speeds across different network conditions
- Validate Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS)

### Cross-Browser Testing
- Test on latest versions of major browsers
- Verify CSS custom properties support
- Check for any browser-specific rendering issues
- Test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Mobile Testing
- Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- Verify touch interactions and mobile-specific behaviors
- Check for any mobile performance issues
- Validate accessibility on mobile screen readers

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- Task 005: Component Migration & Styling - Core components must be migrated
- Task 006: Design System Integration - Design tokens must be implemented

**Parallel Execution:** No - requires completed migration to test effectively

**Conflicts:** None

## Effort Estimate

**Total Effort:** 8 hours (Medium)

**Breakdown:**
- Visual regression test setup: 2 hours
- Performance benchmarking: 2 hours
- Cross-browser testing: 2 hours
- Mobile device testing: 1 hour
- Documentation of results: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All visual regression tests pass with zero breaking changes
- [ ] Performance metrics documented and meet acceptance criteria
- [ ] Bundle size analysis completed with size comparison report
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified on all target browsers
- [ ] Mobile testing completed on minimum 3 physical devices
- [ ] Any performance regressions identified and resolved
- [ ] Test results documented in migration guide
- [ ] All accessibility standards maintained post-migration
- [ ] Responsive design validated across all breakpoints
- [ ] Design system tokens validated in production environment
