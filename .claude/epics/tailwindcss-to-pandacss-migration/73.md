# Extract type definitions from page.tsx

## Task
Extract the TypeScript interfaces from app/page.tsx into a dedicated types file.

### Interfaces to Extract
- `PartyEvent` interface
- `SocialLink` interface

### Target Location
Create `types/index.ts` or `types/wibbly.types.ts`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All interfaces moved to types file
- [ ] Interfaces properly exported
- [ ] page.tsx imports types correctly
- [ ] No TypeScript errors

### Part of Epic
Epic: TailwindCSS to PandaCSS Migration

## Technical Context

The main page.tsx file currently contains inline interface definitions that should be extracted for better organization and reusability. These types are used across the landing page components.

### Current Structure
- Interfaces defined directly in app/page.tsx
- Used by LinksPage and PartiesPage components
- No central types directory exists yet

### Implementation Notes
1. Create types directory if it doesn't exist
2. Extract interfaces to dedicated file
3. Update imports in page.tsx
4. Ensure no breaking changes
