# Extract LinksPage

## Task
Extract the LinksPage component from app/page.tsx into a dedicated component file.

### Component to Extract
- `LinksPage` component and its JSX logic
- Navigation, social links, tickets, and merch sections

### Target Location
Create `components/pages/LinksPage.tsx`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] LinksPage component extracted to separate file
- [ ] Component properly exported
- [ ] Imports data from constants (dependency: #74)
- [ ] All props and dependencies handled correctly
- [ ] page.tsx imports and uses LinksPage component
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Visual and functional behavior unchanged

### Part of Epic
Epic: TailwindCSS to PandaCSS Migration

## Technical Context

The LinksPage component is currently defined inline within the main page.tsx file. It needs to be extracted to improve code organization and maintainability. This component depends on the data constants being extracted first.

### Current Structure
- LinksPage component defined as const inside main component
- Uses hardcoded socialLinks array
- Handles navigation, social links, tickets, and merch sections

### Implementation Notes
1. Extract LinksPage component to separate file
2. Import required dependencies (data, types, UI components)
3. Pass necessary props from parent component
4. Update main page.tsx to import and use extracted component
5. Ensure all styling and functionality remains intact
6. This depends on issue #74 (data constants) being completed first
