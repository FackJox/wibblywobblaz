## Description

Migrate the 20 most-used UI components from TailwindCSS to PandaCSS, applying the fluid design system and component recipes established in previous tasks. This involves converting utility-based styling to semantic PandaCSS patterns while maintaining visual parity and improving maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Core Components Migrated**: Convert 20 highest-priority UI components from `/components/ui/` to PandaCSS
2. **Fluid System Applied**: Apply fluid typography and spacing from Task 002 to each component
3. **Recipe Integration**: Utilize component recipes from Task 003 for consistent styling patterns
4. **Visual Parity**: Ensure migrated components maintain identical visual appearance to current TailwindCSS versions
5. **Performance Validation**: Confirm no performance degradation after migration

## Technical Details

- Priority components to migrate (based on usage analysis):
  - Button, Card, Input, Label, Badge
  - Dialog, Dropdown Menu, Popover, Tooltip
  - Form, Checkbox, Radio Group, Switch
  - Progress, Slider, Separator, Avatar
  - Alert, Toast notifications
- Convert TailwindCSS utility classes to PandaCSS semantic patterns
- Apply component recipes created in Task 003
- Integrate fluid design tokens from Task 002
- Update TypeScript interfaces for new PandaCSS props
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition period
- Test each component in isolation and within existing layouts
- Document migration patterns for remaining components

## Dependencies

- **Task 003**: Component Recipe Creation must be completed
- Requires PandaCSS recipes to be available for component styling
- Needs fluid design tokens from Task 002
- PandaCSS foundation from Task 001

## Effort Estimate

16 hours (Extra Large) - includes component conversion, recipe integration, fluid system application, testing, and documentation.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] 20 core UI components migrated to PandaCSS
- [ ] Fluid design system applied to all migrated components
- [ ] Component recipes integrated and functioning correctly
- [ ] Visual parity maintained with existing TailwindCSS versions
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces updated for PandaCSS compatibility
- [ ] All migrated components tested and validated
- [ ] Migration patterns documented for Task 006
