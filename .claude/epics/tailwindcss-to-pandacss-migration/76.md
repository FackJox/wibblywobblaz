# Extract PartiesPage

## Task
Extract the PartiesPage component from app/page.tsx into a dedicated component file.

### Component to Extract
- `PartiesPage` component and its JSX logic
- Party cards grid, Shhh animation integration
- FREE button handling and ticket purchase logic

### Target Location
Create `components/pages/PartiesPage.tsx`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PartiesPage component extracted to separate file
- [ ] Component properly exported
- [ ] Imports data from constants (dependency: #74)
- [ ] Imports PartyCard component (dependency: #78)
- [ ] All props and dependencies handled correctly
- [ ] page.tsx imports and uses PartiesPage component
- [ ] Shhh animation functionality preserved
- [ ] FREE button and Instagram opening preserved
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Visual and functional behavior unchanged

### Part of Epic
Epic: TailwindCSS to PandaCSS Migration

## Technical Context

The PartiesPage component is currently defined inline within the main page.tsx file. It handles party display, the Shhh animation, and social media integration. This component depends on both data constants and the PartyCard component.

### Current Structure
- PartiesPage component defined as const inside main component
- Uses hardcoded upcomingParties array
- Handles complex Shhh SVG animation logic
- Manages FREE button interaction and Instagram opening
- Contains inline PartyCard rendering logic

### Implementation Notes
1. Extract PartiesPage component to separate file
2. Import required dependencies (data, PartyCard component, types, UI components)
3. Pass necessary props from parent component (handlers, state, refs)
4. Ensure Shhh animation logic is properly handled
5. Update main page.tsx to import and use extracted component
6. Maintain all styling and functionality
7. This depends on issues #74 (data constants) and #78 (PartyCard component)
