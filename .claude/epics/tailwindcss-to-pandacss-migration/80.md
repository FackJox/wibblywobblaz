# Create SwipeableLayout

## Task
Create a reusable SwipeableLayout component to handle the page transition and swipe functionality.

### Component to Create
- SwipeableLayout wrapper component
- Handles horizontal page transitions
- Touch/mouse gesture support
- Page transition animations

### Target Location
Create `components/layout/SwipeableLayout.tsx`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SwipeableLayout component created from scratch
- [ ] Component properly exported with TypeScript interface
- [ ] Accepts pages as children props
- [ ] Handles horizontal swipe gestures (left/right)
- [ ] Manages page transition state
- [ ] Smooth CSS transitions between pages
- [ ] Touch and mouse event support
- [ ] Prevents transitions when already transitioning
- [ ] Configurable transition duration
- [ ] page.tsx uses SwipeableLayout component
- [ ] LinksPage and PartiesPage rendered as children
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] All gesture functionality preserved

### Part of Epic
Epic: TailwindCSS to PandaCSS Migration

## Technical Context

The current page transition logic is embedded in the main page.tsx component. Creating a reusable SwipeableLayout will improve code organization and make the transition system reusable.

### Current Structure
- Page transition wrapper with translateX transforms
- Touch and mouse event handlers
- Transition state management (isTransitioning)
- Gesture detection logic for swipe navigation

### Implementation Notes
1. Create SwipeableLayout component with clean API
2. Accept currentPage and onPageChange props
3. Implement gesture detection and page transition logic
4. Handle both touch and mouse events
5. Provide smooth CSS transitions with configurable timing
6. Ensure proper TypeScript interfaces
7. Update main page.tsx to use SwipeableLayout wrapper
8. This task has no dependencies and can run in parallel
