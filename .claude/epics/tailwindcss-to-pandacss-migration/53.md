## Description

Final cleanup phase to remove all Tailwind dependencies, create comprehensive migration documentation, establish design token workflows, and optimize the codebase. This task ensures a clean handover from Tailwind to PandaCSS with proper documentation and maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All Tailwind CSS dependencies completely removed from project
- [ ] Migration guide created with before/after examples and lessons learned
- [ ] Design system documentation established with token usage guidelines
- [ ] Design token export/publish workflow set up for team collaboration
- [ ] Codebase optimized and cleaned of any migration artifacts

## Technical Details

### Dependency Cleanup
- Remove tailwindcss, @tailwindcss/typography, and related packages
- Remove tailwind.config.js and any Tailwind-specific configuration
- Clean up any unused CSS classes or Tailwind utilities
- Update package.json scripts to remove Tailwind build processes

### Documentation Creation
- Document the complete migration process with step-by-step guide
- Create before/after comparison screenshots
- Document performance improvements and bundle size changes
- Include troubleshooting guide for common migration issues
- Document new PandaCSS workflow and best practices

### Design System Documentation
- Create comprehensive design token documentation
- Document component usage patterns with PandaCSS
- Establish design system maintenance guidelines
- Create examples of custom token creation and usage
- Document responsive design patterns and breakpoint usage

### Workflow Establishment
- Set up design token export for design tools (Figma, Sketch)
- Create token versioning and publishing workflow
- Establish code review guidelines for design system changes
- Set up automated token validation and testing

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- Task 007: Testing & Optimization - Must be completed and all tests passing

**Parallel Execution:** No - Final cleanup requires completed testing phase

**Conflicts:** None

## Effort Estimate

**Total Effort:** 6 hours (Small)

**Breakdown:**
- Dependency cleanup and removal: 1 hour
- Migration guide creation: 2 hours
- Design system documentation: 2 hours
- Workflow setup and automation: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [ ] No Tailwind CSS references remain in codebase (verified via search)
- [ ] All Tailwind dependencies removed from package.json
- [ ] Migration guide complete with examples and troubleshooting
- [ ] Design system documentation published and accessible
- [ ] Token export workflow functional and documented
- [ ] Code review guidelines established for design system changes
- [ ] Performance improvements documented with metrics
- [ ] Team handoff completed with knowledge transfer session
- [ ] Final code review completed and approved
- [ ] All migration artifacts and temporary files removed
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Automated token validation pipeline established
