## Description

Define PandaCSS recipes for core UI components (Button, Card, Form groups), creating reusable variant patterns for component states. This establishes the component-level styling system that will replace Tailwind utility classes with semantic, maintainable PandaCSS recipes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Button Recipes**: Create comprehensive Button recipes with all current variants (primary, secondary, destructive, etc.)
2. **Card Recipes**: Define Card component recipes matching existing shadcn/ui patterns
3. **Form Recipes**: Implement Form group recipes for consistent form styling across the application
4. **Variant Patterns**: Establish clear variant patterns for component states (hover, focus, disabled, etc.)
5. **Token Mapping**: Create component token mappings that utilize the fluid scale system from Task 002

## Technical Details

- Define PandaCSS recipes in `panda.config.ts`:
  - Button recipe with size variants (sm, md, lg) and style variants (primary, secondary, destructive)
  - Card recipe with elevation and border variants
  - Form recipe patterns for inputs, labels, and validation states
- Create component-specific token mappings
- Integrate fluid typography and spacing from Task 002
- Map existing shadcn/ui component styles to PandaCSS recipes
- Test recipes with existing components in `/components/ui/`
- Document recipe usage patterns and variant options

## Dependencies

- **Task 002**: Fluid System Implementation must be completed
- Requires fluid scales to be available for component sizing
- Needs PandaCSS foundation from Task 001

## Effort Estimate

8 hours (Medium) - includes recipe definition, variant creation, component integration, and testing.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Button recipes created with all required variants
- [ ] Card recipes implemented matching current design patterns
- [ ] Form recipes defined for consistent form styling
- [ ] Component variant patterns established and documented
- [ ] Token mappings created utilizing fluid scale system
- [ ] Recipes tested with existing shadcn/ui components
