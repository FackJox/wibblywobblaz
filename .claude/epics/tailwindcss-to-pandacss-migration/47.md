## Description

Configure Utopia.fyi fluid scales for typography and spacing within PandaCSS, generating clamp() functions for fluid values across all breakpoints. This task addresses the critical "WIBBLY WOBBLAZ" typography wrapping issue by implementing true fluid design scales that adapt smoothly between viewport sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Utopia Integration**: Configure Utopia.fyi type and space scales within PandaCSS configuration
2. **Clamp Generation**: Generate appropriate clamp() functions for fluid typography and spacing values
3. **Typography Solution**: Implement fluid typography that prevents "WIBBLY WOBBLAZ" text wrapping at intermediate screen sizes
4. **Space Scale**: Create fluid spacing scale that replaces static Tailwind spacing with responsive values
5. **Cross-browser Testing**: Verify fluid values work correctly across major browsers and devices

## Technical Details

- Configure Utopia.fyi scales:
  - Typography: min 16px @ 320px, max 24px @ 1200px (or appropriate values)
  - Spacing: min 16px @ 320px, max 32px @ 1200px base scale
- Generate CSS custom properties with clamp() functions
- Update PandaCSS theme configuration to use fluid values
- Create utility tokens for common fluid patterns
- Test specifically with "WIBBLY WOBBLAZ" heading at various viewport widths
- Document fluid scale usage patterns

## Dependencies

- **Task 001**: Foundation Setup must be completed first
- Requires PandaCSS configuration to be in place
- Needs working PostCSS pipeline

## Effort Estimate

12 hours (Large) - includes Utopia configuration, clamp generation, extensive testing, and typography problem solving.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Utopia.fyi scales configured in PandaCSS
- [ ] Clamp() functions generated for typography and spacing
- [ ] "WIBBLY WOBBLAZ" no longer wraps at intermediate viewport sizes
- [ ] Fluid spacing scale implemented and tested
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Documentation created for fluid scale usage
