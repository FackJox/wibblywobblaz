# Extract PartyCard

## Task
Extract the individual party card component from the PartiesPage into a dedicated reusable component.

### Component to Extract
- Individual party card with poster, event details, and ticket button
- FREE button for "Hot Ones" events
- GET TICKETS button for regular events
- Date, time, venue, and location display

### Target Location
Create `components/cards/PartyCard.tsx`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PartyCard component extracted to separate file
- [ ] Component properly exported with TypeScript interface
- [ ] Takes PartyEvent as prop
- [ ] Handles both FREE and GET TICKETS button variants
- [ ] Poster image display with fallback
- [ ] Date formatting preserved (DD MMM YYYY uppercase)
- [ ] Hover effects and styling maintained
- [ ] FREE button integration with Shhh animation
- [ ] External ticket links working correctly
- [ ] Accessibility features preserved
- [ ] PartiesPage uses PartyCard component
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Visual and functional behavior unchanged

### Part of Epic
Epic: TailwindCSS to PandaCSS Migration

## Technical Context

The party card is currently rendered inline within the PartiesPage map function. Extracting it will improve code organization and make the component reusable.

### Current Structure
- Party card JSX inside upcomingParties.map()
- Poster display with aspect ratio 3/4
- Event details with icons (Calendar, Clock, MapPin)
- Conditional rendering of FREE vs GET TICKETS button
- Hover effects with color inversion

### Implementation Notes
1. Create PartyCard component with proper TypeScript interface
2. Accept PartyEvent prop and any required handlers (for FREE button)
3. Handle poster image display with proper fallback
4. Implement date formatting logic
5. Preserve all styling and hover effects
6. Handle both button variants (FREE and GET TICKETS)
7. Update PartiesPage to use PartyCard component
8. This task has no dependencies and can run in parallel
