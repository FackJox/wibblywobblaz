## Description

Complete the migration by converting the remaining 23 UI components from TailwindCSS to PandaCSS, ensuring consistency with the core components migrated in Task 004. This final phase consolidates the entire component library under the new PandaCSS system and applies the fluid design patterns uniformly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Complete Component Coverage**: Migrate all remaining UI components in `/components/ui/` to PandaCSS
2. **Pattern Consistency**: Ensure all components follow the same PandaCSS patterns established in Task 004
3. **Fluid Design Application**: Apply complete fluid design system to all remaining components
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify all components work together cohesively in the application
5. **Documentation Completion**: Finalize component usage documentation for the new PandaCSS system

## Technical Details

- Remaining components to migrate (estimated 23 components):
  - Calendar, Command, Context Menu, Date Picker
  - Hover Card, Menubar, Navigation Menu, Pagination
  - Resizable, Sheet, Skeleton, Table
  - Tabs, Textarea, Toggle Group, Toggle
  - Accordion, Aspect Ratio, Collapsible
  - ScrollArea, Select, Sonner (toast system)
  - And any additional utility components
- Apply consistent migration patterns from Task 004:
  - Follow established PandaCSS conversion methodology
  - Use component recipes where applicable
  - Apply fluid typography and spacing tokens
  - Maintain visual consistency with migrated core components
- Comprehensive integration testing:
  - Test component combinations and compositions
  - Verify theme switching works across all components
  - Validate responsive behavior consistency
  - Check animation and interaction states
- Update component exports and type definitions
- Create comprehensive component documentation
- Remove all TailwindCSS dependencies and references

## Dependencies

- **Task 004**: Core Component Migration must be completed
- Requires established PandaCSS patterns and migration methodology
- Needs component recipes and fluid tokens from previous tasks
- Cannot start until core component patterns are validated

## Effort Estimate

12 hours (Large) - includes remaining component migration, consistency validation, comprehensive testing, and final documentation.
