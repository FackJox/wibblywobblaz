# Issue #78: Extract PartyCard Component - Completion Report

## Task Summary
Successfully extracted the individual party card rendering logic into a reusable `PartyCard` component as part of the TailwindCSS to PandaCSS migration epic.

## Implementation Details

### Created Files
- `/components/wibbly/party-card.tsx` - Reusable PartyCard component

### Key Features Implemented

#### PartyCard Component
- **TypeScript Interface**: Complete `PartyCardProps` interface with proper typing
- **Poster Display**: 3/4 aspect ratio with fallback image support
- **Event Details**: Date formatting (DD MMM YYYY uppercase), time, venue, and location
- **Conditional Button Rendering**: 
  - FREE button for hotOnes events with Shhh animation integration
  - GET TICKETS button for regular events with external links
- **Magnetic Hover Effects**: Individual magnetic hover for each card's button
- **Parallax Animation**: Staggered depth parallax effects per card
- **Hover Effects**: Color inversion on hover maintained

#### Technical Improvements
- **Code Organization**: Extracted 180+ lines into reusable component
- **Props Interface**: Clean separation of concerns with proper prop types
- **Animation Integration**: Seamless integration with existing stagger reveal animations
- **Accessibility**: Preserved all ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
