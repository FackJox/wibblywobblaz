# Stream B: Validation & Testing

## Scope
Verify TypeScript compilation and ensure all type references work correctly after extraction

## Files
- app/page.tsx
- types/index.ts

## Progress

### ✅ Validation Completed Successfully

1. **TypeScript Compilation**: Fixed ref type mismatch in `PartiesPage` component
   - Issue: `freeButtonRef` parameter expected `React.RefObject<HTMLButtonElement>` but received `React.RefObject<HTMLButtonElement | null>`
   - Solution: Updated parameter type to `React.RefObject<HTMLButtonElement | null>`
   - Result: TypeScript compilation passes with no errors

2. **ESLint Checks**: Resolved linting warnings
   - Removed unused `Link` import from `app/page.tsx`
   - All critical linting issues resolved
   - Remaining warnings are in unrelated test files

3. **Development Server**: Verified functionality
   - Dev server starts successfully (running on port 3001)
   - No runtime errors detected
   - PandaCSS extraction working properly

4. **Type Import Verification**: Confirmed type extraction success
   - `PartyEvent` and `SocialLink` interfaces imported from `@/types`
   - Types used correctly throughout `app/page.tsx`
   - No TypeScript errors related to type imports

5. **Production Build**: Verified deployment readiness
   - Build completes successfully
   - All pages generate correctly
   - No build-time errors

6. **Type Structure Validation**: Confirmed `/types/index.ts` structure
   - Contains properly exported `PartyEvent` interface with all required properties
   - Contains properly exported `SocialLink` interface with React component typing
   - Clean, centralized type definitions

## Summary
Stream A's type extraction work completed successfully. All TypeScript compilation issues resolved, dev server running without errors, and production build passes. Type imports are working correctly and the extracted interfaces are properly structured in `/types/index.ts`.

**Status: COMPLETED** ✅
