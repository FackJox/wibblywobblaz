# Issue #74 Completion Report

## Task Completed: Extract data constants from page.tsx

### Summary
Successfully extracted hardcoded data arrays from `app/page.tsx` to a dedicated constants file.

### Changes Made

1. **Created new constants file**: `/data/constants.ts`
   - Extracted `upcomingParties` array with all party event data
   - Extracted `socialLinks` array with all social media link data
   - Imported proper TypeScript types from existing `/types/index.ts`
   - Added required icon imports from lucide-react

2. **Updated `app/page.tsx`**:
   - Added import for constants: `import { upcomingParties, socialLinks } from "@/data/constants"`
   - Removed hardcoded data arrays (lines 805-849)
   - Removed unused icon imports (Instagram, Music) as they're now in constants file
   - Maintained all existing functionality and structure

### Data Integrity
- All data structures remain unchanged
- TypeScript types preserved and enforced
- No breaking changes to component interfaces
- All existing functionality maintained

### Verification
- ✅ Build successful with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ All data arrays properly exported from constants file
- ✅ Imports working correctly in page.tsx
- ✅ Data structure and content integrity maintained

### Files Modified
- `/data/constants.ts` (created)
- `/app/page.tsx` (updated imports and removed hardcoded data)

### Benefits
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Centralized data management for easier updates
- Separation of concerns between UI logic and data
- Foundation for future component extractions

### Next Steps
This foundational task enables other component extractions in the epic to proceed with proper data imports from the centralized constants file.
