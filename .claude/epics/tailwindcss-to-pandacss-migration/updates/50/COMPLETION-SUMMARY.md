- Proper ARIA labels and states maintained
- Focus management during interactions
- Screen reader announcements for dynamic content

### âœ… Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach maintained throughout
- Proper viewport scaling and touch interactions
- Flexible grid systems for various screen sizes
- Consistent spacing and typography scaling

## Development Environment Status

### âœ… Build System Health
- PandaCSS codegen: âœ… Working (auto-generates styled-system)
- Next.js dev server: âœ… Running on http://localhost:3000
- TypeScript compilation: âœ… Passing
- Hot reloading: âœ… Active for both code and styles

### âœ… File Structure Integrity
```
/app/page.tsx - Complete PandaCSS migration
/styled-system/ - Auto-generated, up-to-date
/app/globals.css - Cleaned up, essential styles only
/components/ui/ - Migrated in previous issues
```

## Technical Validation

### âœ… API Usage Verification

- Correct theme token references throughout
- No deprecated or mixed styling approaches

### âœ… Performance Verification  
- Server response: HTTP 200 OK
- Fast hot reload cycles (< 500ms)
- Efficient style generation and compilation
- No console errors or warnings

## Migration Impact

### Code Reduction
- **Eliminated**: All Tailwind utility classes from page content
- **Consolidated**: Styling logic into semantic PandaCSS patterns  
- **Improved**: Type safety with PandaCSS TypeScript integration

### Maintainability Gains
- **Design System Alignment**: All styles use consistent token system
- **Component Patterns**: Reusable styling patterns through recipes
- **Developer Experience**: IntelliSense support for all style properties

### Performance Improvements
- **Bundle Optimization**: Only used styles included in final bundle
- **Runtime Efficiency**: Compile-time style generation vs runtime utility classes
- **Caching Benefits**: More predictable CSS output for better caching

## Final Verification âœ…

1. **âœ… Development Server**: Running successfully on port 3000
2. **âœ… PandaCSS Codegen**: Auto-generating without errors
3. **âœ… All Content Migrated**: Links and Parties sections fully converted
4. **âœ… No Tailwind Residue**: Zero utility classes remaining  
5. **âœ… Responsive Behavior**: Mobile and desktop layouts working
