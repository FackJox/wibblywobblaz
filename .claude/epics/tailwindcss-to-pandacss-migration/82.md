### Part of Epic
Epic: TailwindCSS to PandaCSS Migration

## Technical Context

The Shhh animation is a complex interactive element that appears when users click the FREE button on Hot Ones events. It involves SVG animation, state management, and external link opening.

### Current Structure
- Complex animation logic embedded in PartiesPage
- State management for animation phases (hidden/animating/visible)
- CSS keyframe animations with cubic-bezier timing
- Instagram link opening after animation completion
- Accessibility announcements for screen readers

### Implementation Notes
1. Extract animation component with clean props interface
2. Handle animation state either internally or via props
3. Maintain all accessibility features
4. Preserve animation timing and effects
5. Ensure proper cleanup and state management
6. Update PartiesPage to use extracted component
7. This task has no dependencies and can run in parallel
