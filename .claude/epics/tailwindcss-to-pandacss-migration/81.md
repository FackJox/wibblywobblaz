# Refactor main page.tsx

## Task
Refactor the main page.tsx file to use all extracted components, creating a clean and maintainable architecture.

### Components to Import and Use
- NavigationHeader (from #77)
- SwipeableLayout (from #80)
- LinksPage (from #75)
- PartiesPage (from #76)
- Data constants (from #74)
- Shhh animation component (from #82)

### Target Result
Simplified page.tsx with clean component composition

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All extracted components imported and used correctly
- [ ] Data constants imported from dedicated file
- [ ] Main page.tsx significantly reduced in size (target: <200 lines)
- [ ] Clean component composition with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] All state management handled at appropriate levels
- [ ] Props passed correctly to child components
- [ ] Event handlers properly structured
- [ ] SwipeableLayout wraps page components
- [ ] NavigationHeader shared between pages
- [ ] Shhh animation integrated correctly
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] All functionality preserved
- [ ] Visual behavior unchanged
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved

### Part of Epic
Epic: TailwindCSS to PandaCSS Migration

## Technical Context

This is the final integration task that brings together all extracted components into a clean, maintainable architecture. The current page.tsx is monolithic and needs to be restructured to use the extracted components.

### Current Structure
- 1400+ lines of code in single file
- Inline component definitions
- Hardcoded data arrays
- Complex state management mixed with presentation
- Duplicated navigation logic

### Target Structure
- Clean main component with clear responsibilities
- Imported components for all major functionality
- Centralized data management
- Proper prop drilling and state management
- Reusable component architecture

### Implementation Notes
1. This task depends on ALL other extraction tasks being completed
2. Import all extracted components and data
3. Restructure main component to orchestrate child components
4. Ensure proper prop passing and event handling
5. Test thoroughly to ensure no regressions
6. This is the capstone task that cannot run in parallel
