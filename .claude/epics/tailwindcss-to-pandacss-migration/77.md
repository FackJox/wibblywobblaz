# Extract NavigationHeader

## Task
Extract the shared navigation header from app/page.tsx into a dedicated component file.

### Component to Extract
- Shared navigation header used by both LinksPage and PartiesPage
- Desktop and mobile navigation logic
- Brand text ("WIBBLY WOBBLAZ")
- Theme-aware styling based on current page

### Target Location
Create `components/navigation/NavigationHeader.tsx`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] NavigationHeader component extracted to separate file
- [ ] Component properly exported
- [ ] Handles both desktop and mobile navigation
- [ ] Theme-aware styling (light theme for links, dark theme for parties)
- [ ] Mobile menu toggle functionality preserved
- [ ] All navigation buttons work correctly
- [ ] Accessibility features maintained
- [ ] page.tsx imports and uses NavigationHeader component
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Visual and functional behavior unchanged

### Part of Epic
Epic: TailwindCSS to PandaCSS Migration

## Technical Context

The navigation header appears in both LinksPage and PartiesPage with theme-aware styling. It needs to be extracted as a shared component to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

### Current Structure
- Navigation JSX duplicated in both LinksPage and PartiesPage
- Theme-dependent colors (white/black background and text)
- Desktop navigation with LINKS/PARTIES buttons
- Mobile hamburger menu with slide-out navigation
- Brand text with custom Hegval font

### Implementation Notes
1. Extract navigation header to separate component file
2. Create props interface for theme, current page, and handlers
3. Implement theme-aware styling logic
4. Handle mobile menu state and toggle functionality
5. Update both LinksPage and PartiesPage to use shared component
6. Ensure all navigation functionality is preserved
7. This task has no dependencies and can run in parallel
