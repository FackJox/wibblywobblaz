## Description

Install and configure PandaCSS with Next.js 15, establishing the foundation for the TailwindCSS to PandaCSS migration. This includes setting up the PostCSS pipeline, creating base configuration files, and ensuring compatibility with the existing Next.js 15 App Router architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **PandaCSS Installation**: Successfully install PandaCSS and its dependencies, ensuring compatibility with Next.js 15.2.4
2. **PostCSS Pipeline**: Configure PostCSS to process PandaCSS alongside existing Tailwind (during migration phase)
3. **Base Configuration**: Create `panda.config.ts` with initial theme tokens matching current design system
4. **Build Integration**: Verify PandaCSS generates correctly during both development and production builds
5. **Development Workflow**: Ensure hot reloading works properly with PandaCSS changes

## Technical Details

- Install `@pandacss/dev` and required dependencies
- Configure `panda.config.ts` with:
  - Breakpoints matching current Tailwind responsive design
  - Color tokens using HSL values from existing CSS variables
  - Typography scale preparation for Utopia integration
- Update `postcss.config.js` to include PandaCSS processor
- Modify `next.config.mjs` if needed for PandaCSS compatibility
- Test build process with both `npm run build` and `npm run dev`

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundation task that all other migration tasks depend on.

## Effort Estimate

8 hours (Medium) - includes research, installation, configuration, and testing.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] PandaCSS successfully installed and configured
- [ ] PostCSS pipeline processes PandaCSS without conflicts
- [ ] Base configuration file created with initial theme tokens
- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] Production build completes successfully
- [ ] Documentation updated with PandaCSS setup instructions
