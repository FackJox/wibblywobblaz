## Description

Convert the main application page (`app/page.tsx` - 816 lines), layout components, and global styles from TailwindCSS to PandaCSS. This includes migrating complex animations, responsive layouts, and the slide transition system while maintaining the mobile-first design approach.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Main Page Migration**: Convert `app/page.tsx` from TailwindCSS to PandaCSS patterns
2. **Layout System**: Migrate `layout.tsx` and related layout components to PandaCSS
3. **Animation Conversion**: Convert custom keyframes from `globals.css` to PandaCSS animation system
4. **Responsive Design**: Maintain mobile-first responsive design with PandaCSS breakpoints
5. **Navigation System**: Ensure slide transitions between "Links" and "Parties" views work correctly

## Technical Details

- Convert `app/page.tsx` (816 lines) from Tailwind utilities to PandaCSS:
  - Replace grid and flexbox utilities with PandaCSS patterns
  - Convert responsive breakpoint classes to PandaCSS responsive syntax

  - Migrate animation classes to PandaCSS animation system
- Update `app/layout.tsx` and global layout patterns:
