# Extract data constants

## Task
Extract hardcoded data arrays (social links and party events) from app/page.tsx into dedicated constants file.

### Data to Extract
- `socialLinks` array
- `partyEvents` array

### Target Location
Create `constants/data.ts` or `lib/data.ts`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All data arrays moved to constants file
- [ ] Constants properly exported
- [ ] page.tsx imports constants correctly
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Data integrity maintained

### Part of Epic
Epic: TailwindCSS to PandaCSS Migration

## Technical Context

The main page.tsx file currently contains hardcoded data arrays that should be extracted for better organization and maintainability. This is a foundational task that other component extractions depend on.

### Current Structure
- Data arrays defined directly in app/page.tsx
- Used by LinksPage and PartiesPage components
- No central constants directory exists yet

### Implementation Notes
1. Create constants/lib directory if it doesn't exist
2. Extract data arrays to dedicated file
3. Update imports in page.tsx
4. Ensure data structure remains unchanged
5. This task has no dependencies and can run in parallel
