# Extract SocialLinkButton

## Task
Extract the social link button component from LinksPage into a dedicated reusable component.

### Component to Extract
- Individual social link button (Instagram, SoundCloud, etc.)
- Icon, text, and external link arrow
- Hover effects and styling
- External link functionality

### Target Location
Create `components/buttons/SocialLinkButton.tsx`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SocialLinkButton component extracted to separate file
- [ ] Component properly exported with TypeScript interface
- [ ] Takes SocialLink as prop
- [ ] Icon display from lucide-react
- [ ] External link arrow (ExternalLink icon)
- [ ] Proper external link attributes (target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer")
- [ ] Hover effects preserved (white background, black text)
- [ ] Accessibility features maintained
- [ ] LinksPage uses SocialLinkButton component
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Visual and functional behavior unchanged

### Part of Epic
Epic: TailwindCSS to PandaCSS Migration

## Technical Context

The social link buttons are currently rendered inline within LinksPage. They appear in both the "FOLLOW US" section (Instagram, SoundCloud) and could be reused for other link sections.

### Current Structure
- Link component wrapping button-like styling
- Icon from socialLinks data
- Consistent styling with border and hover effects
- External link arrow positioned at right

### Implementation Notes
1. Create SocialLinkButton component with proper TypeScript interface
2. Accept SocialLink prop with name, icon, and url
3. Implement proper external link handling
4. Preserve all styling and hover effects
5. Handle icon rendering from lucide-react
6. Update LinksPage to use SocialLinkButton component
7. Make component reusable for other link types (tickets, merch)
8. This task has no dependencies and can run in parallel
