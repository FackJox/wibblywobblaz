# Task: Verify Spacing Consistency

## Description
Comprehensive testing and verification of the fluid spacing system implementation to ensure consistent spacing across all viewport sizes, maintain accessibility requirements, and validate that the spacing system works as designed without introducing layout issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Spacing tested at all major viewport breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
- [ ] Touch target sizes verified to meet 44px minimum requirement
- [ ] No layout breaks, overlaps, or visual regressions detected
- [ ] Spacing scale values fine-tuned if inconsistencies found
- [ ] Visual rhythm maintained across different screen sizes
- [ ] Component spacing relationships preserved

## Technical Details
- Test responsive behavior using browser dev tools across full viewport range
- Validate touch targets using accessibility inspector
- Check for content overflow, cut-off text, or cramped layouts
- Measure actual spacing values at different breakpoints
- Fine-tune CSS custom properties for space scale if needed
- Document any edge cases or adjustments made

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 30 (Migrate Spacing to Fluid System) must be completed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Multi-viewport testing completed
- [ ] Accessibility requirements verified
- [ ] No layout regressions found
- [ ] Space scale values optimized
- [ ] Testing results documented
- [ ] Final spacing system approved for production
