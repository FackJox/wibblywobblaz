# Task: Migrate Spacing to Fluid System

## Description
Replace all fixed spacing utilities with fluid spacing system in app/page.tsx. This migration ensures consistent spacing that adapts smoothly across all viewport sizes while maintaining visual hierarchy and rhythm.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All fixed padding/margin classes replaced with space-fluid-* utilities
- [ ] Component gaps updated to use fluid spacing
- [ ] Responsive breakpoint-specific spacing removed where appropriate
- [ ] Visual rhythm and alignment preserved across all viewport sizes
- [ ] Touch target sizes maintained at minimum 44px
- [ ] No layout breaks or visual regressions introduced

## Technical Details
- Use mapping table from task 29 to systematically replace spacing classes
- Apply space-fluid-xs through space-fluid-2xl based on semantic meaning
- Update container padding, component margins, and internal spacing
- Replace gap utilities with fluid equivalents
- Remove redundant responsive spacing classes where fluid handles the scaling
- Maintain component composition and layout structure

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 29 (Audit Current Spacing Patterns) must provide migration mapping

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All spacing migrated to fluid system
- [ ] Visual regression testing passed
- [ ] Touch accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Code reviewed for consistency
- [ ] No layout breaks at any viewport size
- [ ] Documentation updated with new spacing approach
