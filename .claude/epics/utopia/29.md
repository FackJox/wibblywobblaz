# Task: Audit Current Spacing Patterns

## Description
Comprehensive audit of all spacing patterns currently used in the application to prepare for migration to a fluid spacing system. This task involves documenting all padding, margin, gap, and space-between utilities to create a complete mapping table for the migration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All padding/margin classes in app/page.tsx documented
- [ ] Current spacing breakpoint patterns mapped (p-4 md:p-8 etc)
- [ ] Gap and space-between usage identified and cataloged
- [ ] Complete mapping table created for spacing migration
- [ ] Current spacing inconsistencies identified
- [ ] Documentation includes usage frequency for each spacing value

## Technical Details
- Scan app/page.tsx for all Tailwind spacing utilities
- Document responsive breakpoint patterns for each spacing instance
- Create structured data format for spacing inventory
- Identify components that use gap, space-x, space-y utilities
- Note any custom spacing values or inconsistent patterns
- Generate migration mapping from current fixed values to fluid equivalents

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 25 (Design Space Scale) must be completed to establish target fluid spacing values

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code audit completed
- [ ] Spacing inventory documented
- [ ] Migration mapping table created
- [ ] Current inconsistencies identified
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved
