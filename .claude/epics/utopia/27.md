# Task: Migrate Typography to Fluid Scaling

## Description
Replace all fixed typography sizes in app/page.tsx with fluid scaling utilities. Apply the new text-fluid-* classes throughout the component while maintaining visual hierarchy and preserving approximate sizes at key breakpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace all fixed text-* classes with fluid text-fluid-* equivalents
- [ ] Remove responsive breakpoint classes (sm:text-*, md:text-*, etc.)
- [ ] Maintain Hegval font usage for headers and key typography
- [ ] Preserve visual hierarchy and relative sizing relationships
- [ ] Ensure approximate size matching at 768px and 1024px breakpoints
- [ ] Update any inline styles that affect typography

## Technical Details
- Use mapping table from task 26 to replace classes systematically
- Apply text-fluid-* classes: text-fluid-xs through text-fluid-9xl
- Maintain font-family assignments (Hegval for headers)
- Test visual consistency during migration process
- Preserve semantic HTML structure

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 26 (Audit Current Typography Usage) must be completed
- [ ] Typography mapping table must be available
- [ ] Fluid typography system must be implemented and tested

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4
- Parallel: false (conflicts with tasks 28, 29 that also modify app/page.tsx)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All typography migrated to fluid scaling
- [ ] Visual hierarchy maintained
- [ ] No fixed breakpoint typography classes remain
- [ ] Component renders correctly at all viewports
- [ ] Code reviewed and tested
