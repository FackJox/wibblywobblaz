# Task: Create Tailwind Utopia Plugin

## Description
Create a custom Tailwind CSS plugin that generates fluid utility classes based on Utopia configuration. The plugin will import the Utopia configuration and generate fluid typography and spacing utilities that scale smoothly between viewport sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Plugin file created at `/plugins/tailwind-utopia.js`
- [ ] Plugin imports and consumes Utopia configuration from lib/utopia-config.js
- [ ] Generates fluid text utilities (text-fluid-xs, text-fluid-sm, etc.)
- [ ] Generates fluid spacing utilities (space-fluid-*, gap-fluid-*, etc.)
- [ ] Supports both rem and pixel value output
- [ ] Plugin follows Tailwind CSS plugin API conventions
- [ ] Plugin is modular and configurable
- [ ] Handles edge cases and invalid configurations gracefully

## Technical Details
The plugin should:
- Use Tailwind's `addUtilities()` function to register new classes
- Generate CSS clamp() functions based on Utopia calculations
- Support all typography steps defined in the configuration
- Support spacing scale for margins, padding, gaps, etc.
- Include proper CSS variable fallbacks
- Follow naming conventions consistent with existing Tailwind utilities

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 23 (Configure Utopia Typography System) must be completed
- [ ] Utopia configuration available in lib/utopia-config.js
- [ ] Tailwind CSS installed and configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 4
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and follows Tailwind plugin patterns
- [ ] Tests written and passing for plugin functionality
- [ ] Plugin generates expected CSS output
- [ ] Error handling for invalid configurations
- [ ] Code reviewed for quality and maintainability
