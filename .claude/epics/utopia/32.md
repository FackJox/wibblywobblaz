# Task: Performance Benchmarking

## Description
Conduct comprehensive performance benchmarking before and after Utopia fluid system implementation. Measure Core Web Vitals, CSS bundle size impact, and rendering performance with CSS calculations to ensure the fluid system meets performance requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Core Web Vitals measured before/after implementation (LCP, FID, CLS)
- [ ] CSS bundle size increase documented and verified < 10KB
- [ ] Rendering performance with CSS calculations benchmarked
- [ ] Performance metrics documented in comparison table
- [ ] Performance regression tests passing
- [ ] Mobile vs desktop performance impact analyzed

## Technical Details
- Use Lighthouse CI for automated Core Web Vitals measurement
- Measure CSS bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer or similar
- Test clamp() calculation performance across different viewport ranges
- Create performance budget alerts for CSS size thresholds
- Benchmark on low-end devices to catch performance regressions
- Document performance characteristics of fluid vs fixed layouts

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 30 (Migrate Spacing to Fluid System) must be completed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance benchmarks collected and documented
- [ ] CSS bundle size verified under 10KB increase
- [ ] Core Web Vitals within acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Performance comparison report created
- [ ] Mobile performance impact assessed
- [ ] Performance monitoring alerts configured
