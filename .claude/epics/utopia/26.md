# Task: Audit Current Typography Usage

## Description
Comprehensive audit of current typography usage in app/page.tsx to prepare for fluid scaling migration. Document all existing text size classes, breakpoint patterns, and font usage to create accurate mapping table for the migration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete scan of app/page.tsx for all text size classes (text-xs to text-9xl)
- [ ] Document all responsive breakpoint patterns (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:)
- [ ] Create mapping table from current fixed sizes to new fluid utilities
- [ ] Identify all Hegval font usage patterns and hierarchy
- [ ] Document current visual hierarchy and spacing relationships
- [ ] Verify no other components use typography classes

## Technical Details
- Use grep/search to find all text-* classes in app/page.tsx
- Document responsive patterns like `text-2xl md:text-4xl lg:text-6xl`
- Map current sizes to appropriate fluid scale values
- Note special cases like Hegval font usage for headers
- Create reference document for migration team

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 25 (Implement Fluid Typography System) must be completed
- [ ] Utopia CSS utilities must be available in globals.css

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2
- Parallel: false (conflicts with 25 if running simultaneously)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code audit completed and documented
- [ ] Mapping table created and reviewed
- [ ] Typography patterns documented
- [ ] No conflicting tasks running on same files
