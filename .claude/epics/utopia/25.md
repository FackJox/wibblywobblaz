# Task: Integrate Plugin with Tailwind Config

## Description
Integrate the custom Utopia Tailwind plugin with the main Tailwind configuration file. Add TypeScript types for the new fluid utilities and ensure backward compatibility with existing utility classes while testing the plugin integration in development mode.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] tailwind.config.ts updated to include Utopia plugin
- [ ] TypeScript types added for fluid utilities (text-fluid-*, space-fluid-*)
- [ ] Plugin configuration options properly exposed
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained with existing utilities
- [ ] Plugin generates utilities correctly in development mode
- [ ] CSS output verified in browser dev tools
- [ ] No conflicts with existing Tailwind utilities
- [ ] Proper error handling for plugin loading failures

## Technical Details
The integration should:
- Import the plugin from `/plugins/tailwind-utopia.js`
- Add plugin to the plugins array in tailwind.config.ts
- Extend TypeScript module declarations for new utility types
- Test utility generation with `npm run dev`
- Verify CSS clamp() functions are generated correctly
- Ensure theme values are properly consumed by the plugin

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 24 (Create Tailwind Utopia Plugin) must be completed
- [ ] Plugin file exists and is functional
- [ ] Tailwind CSS build process working

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with proper TypeScript integration
- [ ] Tests written for configuration loading
- [ ] Documentation updated with new utility classes
- [ ] Plugin integration verified in development environment
- [ ] Code reviewed for configuration best practices
