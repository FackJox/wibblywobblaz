# Task: Test Typography Across Viewports

## Description
Comprehensive testing of migrated fluid typography across all viewport sizes. Verify readability, visual hierarchy, and proper scaling behavior on actual devices and browser viewports. Make adjustments to fluid scale values as needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Visual testing at key breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
- [ ] Test on actual mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Verify no text overflow or unwanted line wrapping
- [ ] Check readability and visual hierarchy preservation
- [ ] Validate smooth scaling transitions between breakpoints
- [ ] Test with different zoom levels (100%, 125%, 150%)

## Technical Details
- Use browser dev tools for viewport testing
- Test on physical devices when possible
- Document any issues with specific viewport ranges
- Adjust clamp() values in CSS if scaling issues found
- Verify accessibility standards for text size minimums
- Check contrast ratios remain compliant

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 27 (Migrate Typography to Fluid Scaling) must be completed
- [ ] All typography must be migrated to fluid system
- [ ] Development server must be running for testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3
- Parallel: true (can run alongside spacing migration tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Testing completed across all target viewports
- [ ] No critical typography issues identified
- [ ] Readability verified on mobile devices
- [ ] Any necessary adjustments implemented
- [ ] Test results documented
- [ ] Sign-off from design/UX team if required
