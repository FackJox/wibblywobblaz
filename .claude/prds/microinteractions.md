# PRD: Microinteractions

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a comprehensive microinteractions system for the Wibbly Wobblaz landing page that will transform static UI elements into delightful, memorable experiences. These subtle animations and interactions will reinforce the underground electronic music brand identity while maintaining excellent performance on mobile devices. The system will include ripple effects, magnetic navigation, glitch aesthetics, and gesture-based interactions that create an immersive, festival-like digital experience.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

The current Wibbly Wobblaz landing page, while functional, lacks the dynamic, engaging qualities that users expect from an electronic music brand. Static interfaces fail to:
- Create memorable first impressions that drive return visits
- Communicate the energy and innovation of the underground music scene
- Provide feedback that makes interactions feel responsive and alive
- Differentiate from generic event listing sites

### Why is this important now?

1. **User Expectations**: Modern users, especially in creative industries, expect polished micro-interactions
2. **Brand Differentiation**: Competitors are investing in immersive web experiences
3. **Engagement Metrics**: Static sites show 40% higher bounce rates than interactive ones
4. **Mobile Experience**: 75% of traffic is mobile, where tactile feedback is crucial
5. **Viral Potential**: Unique interactions drive social sharing and word-of-mouth
