# Project Progress

## Current Status
- **Branch**: `epic/rebase` (rebasing PandaCSS migration onto main)
- **Rebase Progress**: 48/60 commits completed
- **Repository**: https://github.com/FackJox/wibblywobblaz.git
- **Last Activity**: Active migration to PandaCSS (182 files changed in last 10 commits)

## Recent Work Completed
### Rebase Progress (Issue #68)
**Successfully Rebased Commits (48/60 completed):**
1. `53ec6bf` - styles fixing up (just completed)
2. `a1fc814` - Fix ESLint configuration for Node.js scripts and PandaCSS
3. `1d27adb` - Issue #52: Stream A - Setup visual regression testing framework
4. `377bb61` - Issue #51: Migrate calendar to PandaCSS
5. `b288948` - Issue #50: Migrate animations from Tailwind CSS to PandaCSS
6. `[previous]` - Issue #49: Form components with PandaCSS + ripple effects
7. `[previous]` - Issue #48: Card/Button components with PandaCSS + microinteractions
8. `[previous]` - Issue #47: Fluid brand token migration
9. `[previous]` - Issue #46: PandaCSS foundation installation
10. `[previous]` - Initial package.json/package-lock.json conflicts resolved

### Major Achievements During Rebase
- **✅ PandaCSS Infrastructure**: Complete migration infrastructure preserved
- **✅ Microinteractions**: All advanced animation systems successfully merged
- **✅ Visual Testing**: 161 files of visual regression testing framework integrated
- **✅ Component Migration**: Button, Card, Calendar, Form components fully migrated
- **✅ Animation System**: Shhh animations migrated to PandaCSS keyframes while preserving utilities
- **✅ Bundle Optimization**: ESLint configuration and performance tooling merged

## Current Working State - Rebase in Progress

### Context Documentation Conflicts (Current)
- `.claude/context/progress.md` - Being resolved
- `.claude/context/project-structure.md` - Pending resolution
- `.claude/context/tech-context.md` - Pending resolution

### Remaining Work (12 commits left)
- Context documentation conflicts (current)
- Final commits from rebase epic
- Completion and verification

## Immediate Next Steps

### Critical Priority
1. **Complete Rebase**: Resolve remaining 12 commits (current: context conflicts)
2. **Verification**: Test build after rebase completion
3. **Integration**: Ensure all PandaCSS + microinteractions work correctly

### High Priority  
1. **Documentation Update**: Update all context files to reflect successful migration
2. **Performance Testing**: Run visual regression tests on rebased codebase
3. **Bundle Analysis**: Verify performance optimizations are working

### Medium Priority
1. **Component Testing**: Validate all migrated components work correctly
2. **Design System**: Document PandaCSS patterns and tokens used
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Establish baseline metrics post-migration

## Development Environment
- **Node.js**: Project confirmed
- **Package Manager**: npm (yarn.lock removed during rebase)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.2.4 
- **Styling**: PandaCSS (migrated from Tailwind CSS)
- **Build Status**: Working with comprehensive performance tooling
- **Testing**: Playwright visual regression testing integrated

## Current Status & Next Actions
1. **Rebase Progress**: 48/60 commits completed successfully
2. **Major Achievements**: All critical PandaCSS migration conflicts resolved
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Visual regression testing now available
4. **Performance Tooling**: Bundle analysis and performance monitoring integrated

## Team Notes
