## Current Working State

### Modified Files
- No uncommitted changes (clean working directory)

### Added Documentation (Not Committed)
Extensive documentation has been created but not yet committed:
- **Brownfield Architecture** docs (15 files)
- **Decks Feature** specifications (13 files)
- **Microinteractions** stories (16 files)
- **QA Gates** configuration (1 file)

### Deleted Files
- `hooks/use-mobile.tsx` - Mobile hook removed
- `hooks/use-toast.ts` - Toast hook removed (replaced by Sonner)

### Untracked Changes
- `.claude/` directory with PM tooling
- `.olddocs/` directory (backup/archive)
- `CLAUDE.md` file created

## Immediate Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Commit Documentation**: Review and commit the extensive documentation created
2. **Fix Build Configuration**: Re-enable TypeScript and ESLint checking in `next.config.mjs`
3. **Clean Up Commented Code**: Address commented animation code in `app/page.tsx` (lines 29-55)
4. **Fix Memory Leaks**: Proper cleanup for setTimeout handlers in page transitions

### Medium Priority
1. **Implement Features from Docs**: 
   - Microinteractions system (documented but not implemented)
   - Decks feature (audio mixing capability)
2. **Add Testing Infrastructure**: No tests currently exist
3. **Update Event Data**: Move from hardcoded to dynamic event management

### Low Priority
1. **Component Refactoring**: Split monolithic `page.tsx` into smaller components
2. **Performance Optimization**: Enable Next.js image optimization
3. **Error Boundaries**: Add error handling for better resilience

## Development Environment
- **Node.js**: Project confirmed
- **Package Manager**: Yarn (yarn.lock present)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.2.4
- **Build Status**: Working but with warnings disabled

## Blockers & Issues
1. **Build Safety Disabled**: TypeScript and ESLint errors ignored in production builds
2. **No Test Coverage**: No test infrastructure or test files
3. **Technical Debt**: Monolithic component structure, mixed state management
4. **Manual Updates Required**: Hardcoded event dates and data

## Team Notes
- CCPM system initialized and ready for use
- GitHub CLI authenticated and configured
- Git worktree support available for parallel development
- Extensive PM tooling available in `.claude/scripts/pm/`
